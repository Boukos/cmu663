\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
In this paper, I formulated the supervised learning framework for predicting
the publication conference. I explored several ways of encoding the publication
information as features. I also discussed about several common and powerful
classifiers for classification. After a series of experiments and
parameter tuning. I found that the Neural Networks would achieve best
performances. The best feature should be the Deep Learning Word Features
combining with Neural Networks Upstream Conditioning LDA topic distributions.
The best parameters for the model should be 200 hidden nodes for the first
layer.

The future work mainly falls into two parts, the first is to extract features in
a more elgant way. From current result, I could see that the topic distributions
and word features are two different aspects of view on representing dataset and
could help each other. However, I just arbitraryly combine these two features.
Another point is how to overcome overfitting. We could see the results are
sensitive to the number of hidden nodes. And after combining two features, the
input feature size could be very big, thus might lead to overfitting for some
sensitive classifiers like Decision Trees.
