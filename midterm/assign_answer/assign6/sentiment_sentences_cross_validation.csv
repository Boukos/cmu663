neg,"this is not the undisputed worst boxing movie ever , but it's certainly not a champion - the big loser is the audience . "

pos,"twist open the ouzo ! it's time to let your hair down – greek style . a vibrant whirlwind of love , family and all that goes with it , my big fat greek wedding is a non-stop funny feast of warmth , colour and cringe . "

neg,"director carl franklin , so crisp and economical in one false move , bogs down in genre cliches here . "
pos,"a delightful little film that revels in its own simplicity , mostly martha will leave you with a smile on your face and a grumble in your stomach . "
neg,"that is essentially what's missing from blackboards -- the sense of something bigger , some ultimate point . "
pos,broomfield reveals an ironic manifestation of institutionalized slavery that ties a black-owned record label with a white-empowered police force . 
pos,"it's all entertaining enough , but don't look for any hefty anti-establishment message in what is essentially a whip-crack of a buddy movie that ends with a whimper . "
neg,"some movies can get by without being funny simply by structuring the scenes as if they were jokes : a setup , delivery and payoff . stealing harvard can't even do that much . each scene immediately succumbs to gravity and plummets to earth . "
pos,a movie that reminds us of just how exciting and satisfying the fantasy cinema can be when it's approached with imagination and flair . 
neg,"lanie's professional success means she must be a failure at life , because she's driven by ambition and doesn't know how to have fun . "

pos,told just proficiently enough to trounce its overly comfortable trappings . 
neg,slick piece of cross-promotion .

neg,the holiday message of the 37-minute santa vs . the snowman leaves a lot to be desired . 
neg,"trapped presents a frightening and compelling 'what if ? ' scenario that will give most parents pause . . . . then , something terrible happens . "
pos,"it's a square , sentimental drama that satisfies , as comfort food often can . "
neg,"the plot combines the blues brothers and almost famous ( but with bears , and a g rating ) , with an excruciating dollop of disney sentimentality mixed in for good measure . "

pos,"in its treatment of the dehumanizing and ego-destroying process of unemployment , time out offers an exploration that is more accurate than anything i have seen in an american film . "
neg,really does feel like a short stretched out to feature length . 
neg,"though a bit of a patchwork in script and production , a glossy , rich green , environment almost makes the picture work . "
neg,all these developments and challenges facing santa weigh down the plot so heavily that they drain all the film of its energy and needlessly strain credibility . 
neg,"this piece of channel 5 grade trash is , quite frankly , an insult to the intelligence of the true genre enthusiast . "
pos,"texan director george ratliff had unlimited access to families and church meetings , and he delivers fascinating psychological fare . "
pos,at its best ( and it does have some very funny sequences ) looking for leonard reminds you just how comically subversive silence can be . 
pos,a great companion piece to other napoleon films . 
pos,"quitting delivers a sucker-punch , and its impact is all the greater beause director zhang's last film , the cuddly shower , was a non-threatening multi-character piece centered around a public bath house . "
pos,a thought-provoking and often-funny drama about isolation . 
pos,"romantic , riveting and handsomely animated . "
neg,"given the fact that virtually no one is bound to show up at theatres for it , the project should have been made for the tube . "
pos,"a big-budget/all-star movie as unblinkingly pure as the hours is a distinct rarity , and an event . "
neg,now here's a sadistic bike flick that would have made vittorio de sica proud . 
pos,"like vardalos and corbett , who play their roles with vibrant charm , the film , directed by joel zwick , is heartfelt and hilarious in ways you can't fake . "
pos,showtime is a fine-looking film with a bouncy score and a clutch of lively songs for deft punctuation .

pos,"a moving essay about the specter of death , especially suicide . "
pos,an intoxicating experience . 
neg,"hardly makes the kind of points egoyan wanted to make , nor does it exist as the kind of monument he wanted to build , to victims whose voices have never gained the ears of the world . "
neg, . . . hudlin is stuck trying to light a fire with soggy leaves . 
pos,"a thoughtful , moving piece that faces difficult issues with honesty and beauty . "

neg,"the film's lack of personality permeates all its aspects — from the tv movie-esque , affected child acting to the dullest irish pub scenes ever filmed . "
neg,"might have been better off as a documentary , with less of mr . eyre's uninspired dramatics and more of his sense of observation and outrage . "

neg,"if you pitch your expectations at an all time low , you could do worse than this oddly cheerful -- but not particularly funny -- body-switching farce . "
pos,"an engrossing story that combines psychological drama , sociological reflection , and high-octane thriller . "
pos,perhaps no picture ever made has more literally showed that the road to hell is paved with good intentions . 
pos,"an example of quiet , confident craftsmanship that tells a sweet , charming tale of intergalactic friendship . "
neg,derailed by bad writing and possibly also by some of that extensive post-production reworking to aim the film at young males in the throes of their first full flush of testosterone . 
neg,"things really get weird , though not particularly scary : the movie is all portent and no content . "

pos,"director todd solondz has made a movie about critical reaction to his two previous movies , and about his responsibility to the characters that he creates . "
pos,"beating the austin powers films at their own game , this blaxploitation spoof downplays the raunch in favor of gags that rely on the strength of their own cleverness as opposed to the extent of their outrageousness . "

neg,"in the era of the sopranos , it feels painfully redundant and inauthentic . "
pos,a byzantine melodrama that stimulates the higher brain functions as well as the libido . 
pos,"the story may not be new , but australian director john polson , making his american feature debut , jazzes it up adroitly . "
neg,"a film which presses familiar herzog tropes into the service of a limpid and conventional historical fiction , when really what we demand of the director is to be mesmerised . "

neg,"anyone who suffers through this film deserves , at the very least , a big box of consolation candy . "
neg,the master of disguise falls under the category of 'should have been a sketch on saturday night live . '
neg,an extraordinarily silly thriller . 
pos,"maelstrom is strange and compelling , engrossing and different , a moral tale with a twisted sense of humor . "

neg,"an ambitious , guilt-suffused melodrama crippled by poor casting . "
pos,an engrossing portrait of uncompromising artists trying to create something original against the backdrop of a corporate music industry that only seems to care about the bottom line . 
pos,"terry is a sort of geriatric dirty harry , which will please eastwood's loyal fans -- and suits the story , wherein our hero must ride roughshod over incompetent cops to get his man . "

pos,i couldn't recommend this film more . 
neg,"kurys never shows why , of all the period's volatile romantic lives , sand and musset are worth particular attention . "
pos,entertaining despite its one-joke premise with the thesis that women from venus and men from mars can indeed get together . 
pos,"it has a caffeinated , sloppy brilliance , sparkling with ideas you wish had been developed with more care , but animated by an energy that puts the dutiful efforts of more disciplined grade-grubbers to shame . "
pos,you should pay nine bucks for this : because you can hear about suffering afghan refugees on the news and still be unaffected . dramas like this make it human . 
pos,there's . . . an underlying old world sexism to monday morning that undercuts its charm . 
neg,"by the miserable standards to which the slasher genre has sunk , . . . actually pretty good . of course , by more objective measurements it's still quite bad . "
pos,"on the surface a silly comedy , scotland , pa would be forgettable if it weren't such a clever adaptation of the bard's tragic play . "

pos,"overall , interesting as a documentary -- but not very imaxy . "
pos,"[the film] tackles the topic of relationships in such a straightforward , emotionally honest manner that by the end , it's impossible to ascertain whether the film is , at its core , deeply pessimistic or quietly hopeful . "

pos,the film often achieves a mesmerizing poetry . 
pos,"an enjoyable , if occasionally flawed , experiment . "
neg,nothing more than a stifling morality tale dressed up in peekaboo clothing . 
neg,an uneven look into a grim future that doesn't come close to the level of intelligence and visual splendour that can be seen in other films based on philip k . dick stories . 
neg,"it's so crammed with scenes and vistas and pretty moments that it's left a few crucial things out , like character development and coherence . "

pos,"inventive , fun , intoxicatingly sexy , violent , self-indulgent and maddening . "
neg,"a 94-minute travesty of unparalleled proportions , writer-director parker seems to go out of his way to turn the legendary wit's classic mistaken identity farce into brutally labored and unfunny hokum . "
pos,"how i killed my father would be a rarity in hollywood . it's an actor's showcase that accomplishes its primary goal without the use of special effects , but rather by emphasizing the characters -- including the supporting ones . "

pos,"tim allen is great in his role but never hogs the scenes from his fellow cast , as there are plenty of laughs and good lines for everyone in this comedy . "
neg,the film is like a series of beginnings and middles that never take off . 
neg,some motion pictures portray ultimate passion ; others create ultimate thrills . men in black ii achieves ultimate insignificance -- it's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as whiffle-ball epic .

neg, . . . nothing scary here except for some awful acting and lame special effects . 
pos,"the movie occasionally threatens to become didactic , but it's too grounded in the reality of its characters to go over the edge . a touch of humor or an unexpected plot twist always pulls it back . "

neg,a movie in which two not very absorbing characters are engaged in a romance you can't wait to see end .

neg,apparently writer-director attal thought he need only cast himself and his movie-star wife sitting around in their drawers to justify a film . 
neg,"too silly to be frightening , too stolid to be funny , it projects the same lazy affability as its nominal star , david arquette . "
neg,cherish would've worked a lot better had it been a short film . 
neg,"it delivers some chills and sustained unease , but flounders in its quest for deeper meaning . "
pos,a tremendous piece of work . 
neg,"while serving sara does have a long way to go before it reaches the level of crudity in the latest austin powers extravaganza , there's nothing here to match that movie's intermittent moments of inspiration . "
pos,"it was filled with shootings , beatings , and more cussing than you could shake a stick at . "
pos,"a much more successful translation than its most famous previous film adaptation , writer-director anthony friedman's similarly updated 1970 british production . "
neg,"to better understand why this didn't connect with me would require another viewing , and i won't be sitting through this one again . . . that in itself is commentary enough . "
neg,it has the requisite faux-urban vibe and hotter-two-years-ago rap and r&b names and references . 
pos,just offbeat enough to keep you interested without coming close to bowling you over . 
pos,"[  safe conduct  ] is a long movie at 163 minutes but it fills the time with drama , romance , tragedy , bravery , political intrigue , partisans and sabotage . viva le resistance ! "
neg,"a vile , incoherent mess . . . a scummy ripoff of david cronenberg's brilliant 'videodrome . '"
neg,"  feardotcom  has the makings of an interesting meditation on the ethereal nature of the internet and the otherworldly energies it could channel , but it simply becomes a routine shocker . "
pos,"an amusing and unexpectedly insightful examination of sexual jealousy , resentment and the fine line between passion and pretence . "
pos,"hard , endearing , caring , warm . bring tissues . "

pos,"compared to his series of spectacular belly flops both on and off the screen , runteldat is something of a triumph . "
neg,schneider's mugging is relentless and his constant need to suddenly transpose himself into another character undermines the story's continuity and progression .

pos,"thrilling , provocative and darkly funny , this timely sci-fi mystery works on so many different levels that it not only invites , it demands repeated viewings . "
neg,ends up offering nothing more than the latest schwarzenegger or stallone flick would . 
neg,it's a frankenstein-monster of a film that doesn't know what it wants to be . 
pos,"renner ? s face is chillingly unemotive , yet he communicates a great deal in his performance . see it for his performance if nothing else . "
neg,"ends up being mostly about ravishing costumes , eye-filling , wide-screen production design and joan's wacky decision to stand by her man , no matter how many times he demonstrates that he's a disloyal satyr . "
pos,"last orders nurtures the multi-layers of its characters , allowing us to remember that life's ultimately a gamble and last orders are to be embraced . it's affecting , amusing , sad and reflective . "

pos,the script manages the rare trick of seeming at once both refreshingly different and reassuringly familiar . 
neg,the romance between the leads isn't as compelling or as believable as it should be . 
neg,"the action scenes have all the suspense of a 20-car pileup , while the plot holes are big enough for a train car to drive through -- if kaos hadn't blown them all up . "
neg,exactly what you'd expect from a guy named kaos .

neg,"does paint some memorable images . . . , but makhmalbaf keeps her distance from the characters"
neg,"we can't accuse kung pow for misfiring , since it is exactly what it wants to be : an atrociously , mind-numbingly , indescribably bad movie . unfortunately , we'd prefer a simple misfire . "

neg,"there's an epic here , but you have to put it together yourself . "
neg,"unfortunately , it's also not very good . especially compared with the television series that inspired the movie . "
pos,"the director , steven shainberg , has succeeded by focusing intently on his characters , making them quirky individuals rather than figures of fun . "
neg,"the streets , shot by cinematographer michael ballhaus , may be as authentic as they are mean , but it is nearly impossible to care about what happens on them . "
neg,"resident evil is what comes from taking john carpenter's ghosts of mars and eliminating the beheadings . in other words , about as bad a film you're likely to see all year . "
neg,"for a film about explosions and death and spies ,  ballistic : ecks vs . sever  seems as safe as a children's film . well , in some of those , the mother deer even dies . "
neg,nearly every attempt at humor here is doa . 
pos,what makes the movie a comedy is the way it avoids the more serious emotions involved . 
pos,"it's more enjoyable than i expected , though , and that's because the laughs come from fairly basic comedic constructs . cinematic pratfalls given a working over . the cast is spot on and the mood is laid back . "

neg,the film's overall mood and focus is interesting but constantly unfulfilling . 
neg,"it's possible that something hip and transgressive was being attempted here that stubbornly refused to gel , but the result is more puzzling than unsettling . "
pos,"alternating between facetious comic parody and pulp melodrama , this smart-aleck movie . . . tosses around some intriguing questions about the difference between human and android life . "
neg,the ending is a cop-out . what happens to john q ? i don't have an i am sam clue . 
neg,presents a good case while failing to provide a reason for us to care beyond the very basic dictums of human decency . 
neg,"where tom green stages his gags as assaults on america's knee-jerk moral sanctimony , jackass lacks aspirations of social upheaval . "
neg,grating and tedious . 
neg,the balkans provide the obstacle course for the love of a good woman . 
pos,this flick is about as cool and crowd-pleasing as a documentary can get . 
pos,"the story itself it mostly told through on-camera interviews with several survivors , whose riveting memories are rendered with such clarity that it's as if it all happened only yesterday . "
neg,"it's as sorry a mess as its director's diabolical debut , mad cows . "
neg,the script is a dim-witted pairing of teen-speak and animal gibberish . 
neg,i'm giving it thumbs down due to the endlessly repetitive scenes of embarrassment . there's got to be a more graceful way of portraying the devastation of this disease . 
neg,this version of h . g . wells' time machine was directed by h . g . wells' great-grandson . they should have found orson welles' great-grandson . 
neg,"director tom dey demonstrated a knack for mixing action and idiosyncratic humor in his charming 2000 debut shanghai noon , but showtime's uninspired send-up of tv cop show cliches mostly leaves him shooting blanks . "
pos,"the movie isn't always easy to look at . but if it is indeed a duty of art to reflect life , than leigh has created a masterful piece of artistry right here . "
pos,this is christmas future for a lot of baby boomers . 
pos,mike leigh populates his movie with a wonderful ensemble cast of characters that bring the routine day to day struggles of the working class to life
pos,"sensitive , insightful and beautifully rendered film . one of the best of the year . "
neg,"it's hard to care about a film that proposes as epic tragedy the plight of a callow rich boy who is forced to choose between his beautiful , self-satisfied 22-year-old girlfriend and an equally beautiful , self-satisfied 18-year-old mistress . "
pos,"a mix of gritty realism , crisp storytelling and radiant compassion that effortlessly draws you in . "
pos,what emerges is an unsettling picture of childhood innocence combined with indoctrinated prejudice . promises is a compelling piece that demonstrates just how well children can be trained to live out and carry on their parents' anguish . 
pos,"an unflinching , complex portrait of a modern israel that is rarely seen on-screen . "
pos,it's secondary to american psycho but still has claws enough to get inside you and stay there for a couple of hours . 
neg,"a nearly 21/2 hours , the film is way too indulgent . "
pos,captivates and shows how a skillful filmmaker can impart a message without bludgeoning the audience over the head . 
neg,the lack of naturalness makes everything seem self-consciously poetic and forced . . . it's a pity that [nelson's] achievement doesn't match his ambition . 
pos,i love the opening scenes of a wintry new york city in 1899 . cinematic poetry showcases the city's old-world charm before machines change nearly everything . 
neg,abandons all pretense of creating historical context and waltzes off into a hectic soap about the ups and downs of the heavy breathing between the two artists . 
neg,"despite her relentless vim and winsome facial symmetry , witherspoon is just too dialed-up to be america's sweetheart . "
pos,"it dares to be a little different , and that shading is what makes it worthwhile . "
neg,"no dia em que aceitou dirigir esta continuação , harold ramis deve ter saído da cama com o pé esquerdo . e aqueles que decidiram assistir a este filme também . "
pos,"though the controversial korean filmmaker's latest effort is not for all tastes , it offers gorgeous imagery , effective performances , and an increasingly unsettling sense of foreboding . "

neg,everything that's worthwhile about collision course can already be seen on television . 
pos,"presents a side of contemporary chinese life that many outsiders will be surprised to know exists , and does so with an artistry that also smacks of revelation . "
neg,"an empty exercise , a florid but ultimately vapid crime melodrama with lots of surface flash but little emotional resonance . "
neg,"i didn't laugh at the ongoing efforts of cube , and his skinny buddy mike epps , to make like laurel and hardy 'n the hood . "
neg,murphy and wilson actually make a pretty good team . . . but the project surrounding them is distressingly rote . 
pos,"victor rosa is leguizamo's best movie work so far , a subtle and richly internalized performance . "
neg,"this movie is so bad , that it's almost worth seeing because it's so bad . "
neg,"you might say tykwer has done all that heaven allows , if you wanted to make as anti-kieslowski a pun as possible . suffice to say its total promise is left slightly unfulfilled . "
neg,"very special effects , brilliantly bold colors and heightened reality can't hide the giant achilles' heel in  stuart little 2  : there's just no story , folks . "
pos,both a beautifully made nature film and a tribute to a woman whose passion for this region and its inhabitants still shines in her quiet blue eyes . 
pos,"the spaniel-eyed jean reno infuses hubert with a mixture of deadpan cool , wry humor and just the measure of tenderness required to give this comic slugfest some heart . "
pos,'they' begins and ends with scenes so terrifying i'm still stunned . and i've decided to leave a light on every night from now on . 
neg,the niftiest trick perpetrated by the importance of being earnest is the alchemical transmogrification of wilde into austen--and a hollywood-ized austen at that . 
neg,"the secrets of time travel will have been discovered , indulged in and rejected as boring before i see this piece of crap again . "
neg,"while we want macdowell's character to retrieve her husband , we have to ask whether her personal odyssey trumps the carnage that claims so many lives around her . "
neg,no amount of good acting is enough to save oleander's uninspired story . 
neg,the subject of swinging still seems ripe for a documentary -- just not this one . 
neg,"the people in abc africa are treated as docile , mostly wordless ethnographic extras . "
pos,it manages to squeeze by on angelina jolie's surprising flair for self-deprecating comedy . 
pos,"third time's the charm . . . yeah , baby ! "
neg,"it's badly acted , blandly directed , and could have been scripted by someone who just graduated from elementary school . "
pos,"one of recent memory's most thoughtful films about art , ethics , and the cost of moral compromise . "
pos,go see it and enjoy . 
neg,"muddled , melodramatic paranormal romance is an all-time low for kevin costner . "
neg,"green ruins every single scene he's in , and the film , while it's not completely wreaked , is seriously compromised by that . "
neg,never capitalizes on this concept and opts for the breezy and amateurish feel of an after school special on the subject of tolerance . 
pos,"you wouldn't want to live waydowntown , but it is a hilarious place to visit . "
neg,"muddled , simplistic and more than a little pretentious . "
neg,"contains a few big laughs but many more that graze the funny bone or miss it altogether , in part because the consciously dumbed-down approach wears thin . "
pos,both damning and damned compelling . 
pos,"a coming-of-age tale from new zealand whose boozy , languid air is balanced by a rich visual clarity and deeply felt performances across the board . "
neg,director barry skolnick and his screenwriters glibly tick off every point of  the longest yard  playbook like a checklist . 
neg,"jacobi , the most fluent of actors , is given relatively dry material from nijinsky's writings to perform , and the visuals , even erotically frank ones , become dullingly repetitive . "
neg,this dubious product of a college-spawned ( colgate u . ) comedy ensemble known as broken lizard plays like a mix of cheech and chong and chips . 
neg,"rambles on in a disjointed , substandard fashion from one poorly executed action sequence to the next . "
neg,a living testament to the power of the eccentric and the strange . the fact that it isn't very good is almost beside the point . 
pos,a thoroughly entertaining comedy that uses grant's own twist of acidity to prevent itself from succumbing to its own bathos . 
neg,trying to make head or tail of the story in the hip-hop indie snipes is enough to give you brain strain -- and the pay-off is negligible . 
pos,"the performances are immaculate , with roussillon providing comic relief . "
pos,kept aloft largely by a comically adept ensemble . 
neg,"herzog is obviously looking for a moral to his fable , but the notion that a strong , unified showing among germany and eastern european jews might have changed 20th-century history is undermined by ahola's inadequate performance . "
neg,"as spent screen series go , star trek : nemesis is even more suggestive of a 65th class reunion mixer where only eight surviving members show up -- and there's nothing to drink . "
pos,"this is not chabrol's best , but even his lesser works outshine the best some directors can offer . "
pos,"for those who like quirky , slightly strange french films , this is a must ! "
pos,"  nicholas nickleby  is a perfect family film to take everyone to since there's no new  a christmas carol  out in the theaters this year . charlie hunnam has the twinkling eyes , repressed smile and determined face needed to carry out a dickensian hero . "

neg,`matrix'-style massacres erupt throughout . . . but the movie has a tougher time balancing its violence with kafka-inspired philosophy . 
neg,"the movie is so resolutely cobbled together out of older movies that it even uses a totally unnecessary prologue , just because it seems obligatory . "
pos,"the ingenious construction ( adapted by david hare from michael cunningham's novel ) constantly flows forwards and back , weaving themes among three strands which allow us to view events as if through a prism"
pos, . . . myers has turned his franchise into the movie version of an adolescent dirty-joke book done up in post-tarantino pop-culture riffs . . . 
pos,"we admire this film for its harsh objectivity and refusal to seek our tears , our sympathies . "
neg,lawrence should stick to his day job . he's a better actor than a standup comedian . 
pos,"hoffman notches in the nuances of pain , but his smart , edgy voice and waddling profile ( emphasized here ) accent the humor of wilson's plight , and that saves his pathos from drippiness . "
pos,"will assuredly rank as one of the cleverest , most deceptively amusing comedies of the year . "
neg,at once half-baked and overheated . 
pos,[villeneuve] seems to realize intuitively that even morality is reduced to an option by the ultimate mysteries of life and death . 
neg,why spend $9 on the same stuff you can get for a buck or so in that greasy little vidgame pit in the theater lobby ? 
neg,"ostensibly celebrates middle-aged girl power , even as it presents friendship between women as pathetic , dysfunctional and destructive . "

pos,kinnear and dafoe give what may be the performances of their careers . 
neg,sewer rats could watch this movie and be so skeeved out that they'd need a shower .

neg,this is a movie where the most notable observation is how long you've been sitting still . 
neg,a wretched movie that reduces the second world war to one man's quest to find an old flame . 
pos,most thrillers send audiences out talking about specific scary scenes or startling moments ;  frailty  leaves us with the terrifying message that the real horror may be waiting for us at home . 
pos,foster breathes life into a roll that could have otherwise been bland and run of the mill . 
neg,here's a self-congratulatory 3d imax rah-rah .

neg,the tone shifts abruptly from tense to celebratory to soppy . 
pos,"well-written , nicely acted and beautifully shot and scored , the film works on several levels , openly questioning social mores while ensnaring the audience with its emotional pull . "
neg,it's just hard to believe that a life like this can sound so dull .

pos,"ourside the theatre roger might be intolerable company , but inside it he's well worth spending some time with . "
pos,"parker holds true to wilde's own vision of a pure comedy with absolutely no meaning , and no desire to be anything but a polished , sophisticated entertainment that is in love with its own cleverness . "
pos,an impressive hybrid . 
neg,"each story on its own could have been expanded and worked into a compelling single feature , but in its current incarnation , storytelling never quite gets over its rather lopsided conception . "
pos,"exquisitely acted and masterfully if preciously interwoven… [the film] addresses in a fascinating , intelligent manner the intermingling of race , politics and local commerce . "
pos,don't expect any surprises in this checklist of teamwork cliches . . . 
neg,a sequence of ridiculous shoot-'em-up scenes . 
neg,sheridan's take on the author's schoolboy memoir . . . is a rather toothless take on a hard young life . 
neg,"elegantly crafted but emotionally cold , a puzzle whose intricate construction one can admire but is difficult to connect with on any deeper level . "

neg,"the movie is as far as you can get from racy , to the point where it almost stops the blood flow to your brain ; it has a dull , costumey feel . "
neg,the film rehashes several old themes and is capped with pointless extremes -- it's insanely violent and very graphic . 
neg,"too loud , too long and too frantic by half , die another day suggests that the bond franchise has run into a creative wall that 007 cannot fly over , tunnel under or barrel through . "
neg,"frida is certainly no disaster , but neither is it the kahlo movie frida fans have been looking for . "

pos,"not so much a movie as a picture book for the big screen . this isn't my favorite in the series , still i enjoyed it enough to recommend . "
pos,it's anchored by splendid performances from an honored screen veteran and a sparkling newcomer who instantly transform themselves into a believable mother/daughter pair . 
pos,"everytime you think undercover brother has run out of steam , it finds a new way to surprise and amuse . "
pos,it inspires a continuing and deeply satisfying awareness of the best movies as monumental 'picture shows . '
pos,"the story loses its bite in a last-minute happy ending that's even less plausible than the rest of the picture . much of the way , though , this is a refreshingly novel ride . "
neg,"one of those films where the characters inhabit that special annex of hell where adults behave like kids , children behave like adults and everyone screams at the top of their lungs no matter what the situation . "
neg,"cacoyannis' vision is far less mature , interpreting the play as a call for pity and sympathy for anachronistic phantasms haunting the imagined glory of their own pasts . "
pos,what better message than 'love thyself' could young women of any size receive ? 
neg,it appears to have been made by people to whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept . 
pos,"all the filmmakers are asking of us , is to believe in something that is improbable . "
neg,"a fitfully amusing romp that , if nothing else , will appeal to fans of malcolm in the middle and its pubescent star , frankie muniz . "
pos,"it's a technically superb film , shining with all the usual spielberg flair , expertly utilizing the talents of his top-notch creative team . "
neg,"the movie's something-borrowed construction feels less the product of loving , well integrated homage and more like a mere excuse for the wan , thinly sketched story . killing time , that's all that's going on here . "
pos,reign of fire just might go down as one of the all-time great apocalypse movies . 
pos,"like a skillful fisher , the director uses the last act to reel in the audience since its poignancy hooks us completely . "
pos,"it's endearing to hear madame d . refer to her husband as 'jackie' -- and he does make for excellent company , not least as a self-conscious performer . "
pos,"with an unflappable air of decadent urbanity , everett remains a perfect wildean actor , and a relaxed firth displays impeccable comic skill . "
pos,"a work of the utmost subtlety and perception , it marks the outstanding feature debut of writer-director eric byler , who understands the power of the implicit and the virtues of simplicity and economy . "
neg,storytelling feels slight . 
pos,"if it seems like a minor miracle that its septuagenarian star is young enough to be the nonagenarian filmmaker's son , more incredible still are the clear-eyed boldness and quiet irony with which actor and director take on life's urgent questions . "
pos,it's a bit disappointing that it only manages to be decent instead of dead brilliant . 
neg,"even in terms of the low-grade cheese standards on which it operates , it never quite makes the grade as tawdry trash . "
neg,"with its lackadaisical plotting and mindless action , all about the benjamins evokes the bottom tier of blaxploitation flicks from the 1970s . "
neg,"but buying into sham truths and routine  indie  filmmaking , freundlich has made just another safe movie . it's not horrible , just horribly mediocre . "
neg," . . . a cheap , ludicrous attempt at serious horror . "
pos,rifkin's references are . . . impeccable throughout . 
pos,an intriguing look at the french film industry during the german occupation ; its most delightful moments come when various characters express their quirky inner selves . 
pos,"lovingly photographed in the manner of a golden book sprung to life , stuart little 2 manages sweetness largely without stickiness . "
neg,a thriller without thrills and a mystery devoid of urgent questions . 
neg,"not a movie but a live-action agitprop cartoon so shameless and coarse , it's almost funny . "
pos,"sweetly sexy , funny and touching . "
neg,"not always too whimsical for its own good ( but enough to do harm ) , this strange hybrid of crime thriller , quirky character study , third-rate romance and female empowerment fantasy never really finds the tonal or thematic glue it needs . "
pos,returning director rob minkoff . . . and screenwriter bruce joel rubin . . . have done a fine job of updating white's dry wit to a new age . 
pos,a virtual roller-coaster ride of glamour and sleaze . 
neg,"no number of fantastic sets , extras , costumes and spectacular locales can disguise the emptiness at the center of the story . "
pos,"offers an unusual opportunity to observe the inequities in the death penalty , not just the inherent immorality but also the haphazard administration of it and public misperception of how the whole thing works . "
pos,my little eye is the best little  horror  movie i've seen in years .

neg,you're better off staying home and watching the x-files . 
neg,dolman confines himself to shtick and sentimentality -- the one bald and the other sloppy .

pos,"day is not a great bond movie , but it is a good bond movie , which still makes it much better than your typical bond knock-offs . "
neg,"mattei is tiresomely grave and long-winded , as if circularity itself indicated profundity . "
pos,"more than anything else , kissing jessica stein injects freshness and spirit into the romantic comedy genre , which has been held hostage by generic scripts that seek to remake sleepless in seattle again and again . "
neg,"laconic and very stilted in its dialogue , this indie flick never found its audience , probably because it's extremely hard to relate to any of the characters . "
neg,"any movie this boring should be required to have ushers in the theater that hand you a cup of coffee every few minutes . like a marathon runner trying to finish a race , you need a constant influx of liquid just to get through it . "
neg,"'linklater fans , or pretentious types who want to appear avant-garde will suck up to this project . . . '"
neg,"it's a lot to ask people to sit still for two hours and change watching such a character , especially when rendered in as flat and impassive a manner as phoenix's . "
neg,director boris von sychowski instead opts for a routine slasher film that was probably more fun to make than it is to sit through . 
pos,"instead of hitting the audience over the head with a moral , schrader relies on subtle ironies and visual devices to convey point of view . "

pos,takes a fresh and absorbing look at a figure whose legacy had begun to bronze . 
neg,director roger michell does so many of the little things right that it's difficult not to cuss him out severely for bungling the big stuff . 
pos,"the hook is the drama within the drama , as an unsolved murder and an unresolved moral conflict jockey for the spotlight . "
pos,"now trimmed by about 20 minutes , this lavish three-year-old production has enough grandeur and scale to satisfy as grown-up escapism . "
pos,flawed but worthy look at life in u . s . relocation camps . 
neg,"when a film is created solely because it's a marketable product , soulless and ugly movies like this are the result . let your silly childhood nostalgia slumber unmolested . "
neg,villeneuve spends too much time wallowing in bibi's generic angst ( there are a lot of shots of her gazing out windows ) . 
neg,"it's a hellish , numbing experience to watch , and it doesn't offer any insights that haven't been thoroughly debated in the media already , back in the dahmer heyday of the mid-'90s . "
neg,a technical triumph and an extraordinary bore . 
pos,a spiffy animated feature about an unruly adolescent boy who is yearning for adventure and a chance to prove his worth . 
neg,"scotland , pa . is a strangely drab romp . some studio pizazz might have helped . "

pos,"an enthralling aesthetic experience , one that's steeped in mystery and a ravishing , baroque beauty . "
neg,"lacking gravitas , macdowell is a placeholder for grief , and ergo this sloppy drama is an empty vessel . leave these flowers unpicked -- they're dead on the vine . "
pos,"sound the trumpets : for the first time since desperately seeking susan , madonna doesn't suck as an actress . "
neg,"the inevitable double- and triple-crosses arise , but the only drama is in waiting to hear how john malkovich's reedy consigliere will pronounce his next line . "
neg,"woo has as much right to make a huge action sequence as any director , but how long will filmmakers copy the  saving private ryan  battle scenes before realizing steven spielberg got it right the first time ? "
neg,it's mired in a shabby script that piles layer upon layer of action man cliché atop wooden dialogue and a shifting tone that falls far short of the peculiarly moral amorality of [woo's] best work . 
pos,"between them , de niro and murphy make showtime the most savory and hilarious guilty pleasure of many a recent movie season . "
pos,"a fine documentary can be distinguished from a mediocre one by the better film's ability to make its subject interesting to those who aren't part of its supposed target audience . judging by those standards , 'scratch' is a pretty decent little documentary . "
pos,"the problems and characters it reveals are universal and involving , and the film itself -- as well its delightful cast -- is so breezy , pretty and gifted , it really won my heart . "
pos,this movie got me grinning . there's a part of us that cannot help be entertained by the sight of someone getting away with something . 
pos,the movie should be credited with remembering his victims . 
pos,the biggest problem with this movie is that it's not nearly long enough . 
neg,a string of rehashed sight gags based in insipid vulgarity . 
pos,"this fascinating experiment plays as more of a poetic than a strict reality , creating an intriguing species of artifice that gives the lady and the duke something of a theatrical air . "
pos,robin williams has thankfully ditched the saccharine sentimentality of bicentennial man in favour of an altogether darker side . 
neg,perhaps the most annoying thing about who is cletis tout ? is that it's a crime movie made by someone who obviously knows nothing about crime . 
neg,it's not as awful as some of the recent hollywood trip tripe . . . but it's far from a groundbreaking endeavor . 
neg,"it would be churlish to begrudge anyone for receiving whatever consolation that can be found in dragonfly , yet it is impossible to find the film anything but appalling , shamelessly manipulative and contrived , and totally lacking in conviction . "
pos,"for the first time in years , de niro digs deep emotionally , perhaps because he's been stirred by the powerful work of his co-stars . "
neg,what a great shame that such a talented director as chen kaige has chosen to make his english-language debut with a film so poorly plotted and scripted . 
neg,"harrison's flowers puts its heart in the right place , but its brains are in no particular place at all . "
pos,"it's a hoot watching the rock chomp on jumbo ants , pull an arrow out of his back , and leap unscathed through raging fire ! "
neg,there ain't a lot more painful than an unfunny movie that thinks it's hilarious . 
neg,"and if you appreciate the one-sided theme to lawrence's over-indulgent tirade , then knock yourself out and enjoy the big screen postcard that is a self-glorified martin lawrence lovefest . if you are willing to do this , then you so crazy ! "
neg,"before it takes a sudden turn and devolves into a bizarre sort of romantic comedy , steven shainberg's adaptation of mary gaitskill's harrowing short story . . . is a brilliantly played , deeply unsettling experience . "
pos,"the fact is that the screen is most alive when it seems most likely that broomfield's interviewees , or even himself , will not be for much longer . "
pos,one of the most splendid entertainments to emerge from the french film industry in years . 
neg,"it's a big idea , but the film itself is small and shriveled . "
pos,a quietly reflective and melancholy new zealand film about an eventful summer in a 13-year-old girl's life . 
neg,"after sitting through this sloppy , made-for-movie comedy special , it makes me wonder if lawrence hates criticism so much that he refuses to evaluate his own work . "
neg,grant isn't cary and bullock isn't katherine . 
pos,"combines sharp comedy , old-fashioned monster movie atmospherics , and genuine heart to create a film that's not merely about kicking undead * * * , but also about dealing with regret and , ultimately , finding redemption . "
pos,"hardly an objective documentary , but it's great cinematic polemic . . . love moore or loathe him , you've got to admire . . . the intensity with which he's willing to express his convictions . "
pos,"the last scenes of the film are anguished , bitter and truthful . mr . koshashvili is a director to watch . "
neg,"as a hybrid teen thriller and murder mystery , murder by numbers fits the profile too closely . "
neg,"all the amped-up tony hawk-style stunts and thrashing rap-metal can't disguise the fact that , really , we've been here , done that . "
pos,"sure , it's contrived and predictable , but its performances are so well tuned that the film comes off winningly , even though it's never as solid as you want it to be . "
pos,"a dark , quirky road movie that constantly defies expectation . "
neg,gaghan . . . has thrown every suspenseful cliché in the book at this nonsensical story . 
neg,"director yu seems far more interested in gross-out humor than in showing us well-thought stunts or a car chase that we haven't seen 10 , 000 times . "
neg,ah-nuld's action hero days might be over . 
neg,it has all the excitement of eating oatmeal . 
pos,there is simply no doubt that this film asks the right questions at the right time in the history of our country . 
pos,"boasts a handful of virtuosic set pieces and offers a fair amount of trashy , kinky fun . "
pos,"it's a smartly directed , grown-up film of ideas . "
neg,"the charms of willful eccentricity , at least as evidenced by this latest cinematic essay , are beginning to wear a bit thin . "
pos,"one feels the dimming of a certain ambition , but in its place a sweetness , clarity and emotional openness that recalls the classics of early italian neorealism . "
pos,the film has several strong performances . 
neg,"the problem , amazingly enough , is the screenplay . "
neg,"sometimes this modest little number clicks , and sometimes it doesn't . "
pos,"a witty , whimsical feature debut . "
pos,"the story wraps back around on itself in the kind of elegant symmetry that's rare in film today , but be warned : it's a slow slog to get there . "
neg,"to work , love stories require the full emotional involvement and support of a viewer . that is made almost impossible by events that set the plot in motion . "
pos,craig bartlett and director tuck tucker should be commended for illustrating the merits of fighting hard for something that really matters . 
neg, . . . stale and uninspired . 
pos,"daughter from danang is a film that should be seen by all , especially those who aren't aware of , or have forgotten about the unmentioned victims of war . "
pos,"whether writer-director anne fontaine's film is a ghost story , an account of a nervous breakdown , a trip down memory lane , all three or none of the above , it is as seductive as it is haunting . "
neg,"it's the element of condescension , as the filmmakers look down on their working-class subjects from their lofty perch , that finally makes sex with strangers , which opens today in the new york metropolitan area , so distasteful . "
pos,"in the end , the film is less the cheap thriller you'd expect than it is a fairly revealing study of its two main characters — damaged-goods people whose orbits will inevitably and dangerously collide . "
pos,marvelously entertaining and deliriously joyous documentary . 
pos,"a stylish but steady , and ultimately very satisfying , piece of character-driven storytelling . "
neg,an entertainment so in love with its overinflated mythology that it no longer recognizes the needs of moviegoers for real characters and compelling plots . 
pos,the movie is a trove of delights . 
pos,fudges fact and fancy with such confidence that we feel as if we're seeing something purer than the real thing . 
pos,a flick about our infantilized culture that isn't entirely infantile . 
neg,i'd have to say the star and director are the big problems here . 
neg, . . . better described as a ghost story gone badly awry . 
neg,"a standard police-oriented drama that , were it not for de niro's participation , would have likely wound up a tnt original . "
pos,you have enough finely tuned acting to compensate for the movie's failings . 
pos,"it's got some pretentious eye-rolling moments and it didn't entirely grab me , but there's stuff here to like . "
pos,it's so good that you can practically see the hollywood 'suits' trying to put together the cast and filmmaking team for the all-too -inevitable american remake . 
neg,it appears as if even the filmmakers didn't know what kind of movie they were making . 
pos,"chicago offers much colorful eye candy , including the spectacle of gere in his dancing shoes , hoofing and crooning with the best of them . "
neg,"whaley's determination to immerse you in sheer , unrelenting wretchedness is exhausting . "
neg,"after several scenes of this tacky nonsense , you'll be wistful for the testosterone-charged wizardry of jerry bruckheimer productions , especially because half past dead is like the rock on a wal-mart budget . "
pos,"the bodily function jokes are about what you'd expect , but there are rich veins of funny stuff in this movie . "
neg,"while the mystery surrounding the nature of the boat's malediction remains intriguing enough to sustain mild interest , the picture refuses to offer much accompanying sustenance in the way of characterization , humor or plain old popcorn fun . "
pos,a film of ideas and wry comic mayhem . 
neg," . . . the film falls back on the same old formula of teen sex , outrageous pranks and scenes designed to push the envelope of bad taste for laughs . "
neg,"there's the plot , and a maddeningly insistent and repetitive piano score that made me want to scream . "
pos,"an intelligent , earnest , intimate film that drops the ball only when it pauses for blunt exposition to make sure you're getting its metaphysical point . "
pos," . . . a fun little timewaster , helped especially by the cool presence of jean reno . "
neg,a lame comedy . 
pos,"lends itself to the narcotizing bland ( sinister , though not nearly so sinister as the biennial disney girl movie ) machinations of the biennial disney boy movie . "
neg,formula 51 is so trite that even yu's high-energy action stylings can't break through the stupor . 
neg,fluffy neo-noir hiding behind cutesy film references . 
neg,absolutely ( and unintentionally ) terrifying . 
pos,"koury frighteningly and honestly exposes one teenager's uncomfortable class resentment and , in turn , his self-inflicted retaliation . "
neg,"doesn't offer much besides glib soullessness , raunchy language and a series of brutal set pieces . . . that raise the bar on stylized screen violence . "
pos,"while it would be easy to give crush the new title of two weddings and a funeral , it's a far more thoughtful film than any slice of hugh grant whimsy . "
pos,a winning and wildly fascinating work . 
pos,the primitive force of this film seems to bubble up from the vast collective memory of the combatants . it's like watching a nightmare made flesh . 
pos,"in the director's cut , the film is not only a love song to the movies but it also is more fully an example of the kind of lush , all-enveloping movie experience it rhapsodizes . "
neg,"it kinda works and qualifies as cool at times , but is just too lame to work or be cool at others . "
pos,"the people in dogtown and z-boys are so funny , aggressive and alive , you have to watch them because you can't wait to see what they do next . "
neg,well-meaning but inert . 
pos,"the film is a hoot , and is just as good , if not better than much of what's on saturday morning tv especially the pseudo-educational stuff we all can't stand . "
neg,this isn't even madonna's swept away . this is her blue lagoon . 
neg,an instant candidate for worst movie of the year . 
pos,part of the charm of satin rouge is that it avoids the obvious with humour and lightness . 
pos,thurman and lewis are hilarious throughout . 
pos,"jirí hubac's script is a gem . his characters are engaging , intimate and the dialogue is realistic and greatly moving . the scope of the silberstein family is large and we grow attached to their lives , full of strength , warmth and vitality . . "
pos,"a summer entertainment adults can see without feeling embarrassed , but it could have been more . "
pos,a coming-of-age film that avoids the cartoonish clichés and sneering humor of the genre as it provides a fresh view of an old type -- the uncertain girl on the brink of womanhood . 
pos,this 90-minute postmodern voyage was more diverting and thought-provoking than i'd expected it to be . 
neg,"[the kid's] just too bratty for sympathy , and as the film grows to its finale , his little changes ring hollow . "
neg,an awful snooze . 
neg,"too smart to ignore but a little too smugly superior to like , this could be a movie that ends up slapping its target audience in the face by shooting itself in the foot . "
neg,the thrill is ( long ) gone . 
neg,barrels along at the start before becoming mired in sentimentality . 
pos,a little better than sorcerer's stone . 
pos,enjoy it for what it is ; you can hate yourself later . 
neg,it won't be long before you'll spy i spy at a video store near you . 
neg,"can't kick about the assembled talent and the russos show genuine promise as comic filmmakers . still , this thing feels flimsy and ephemeral . "
pos,"a delightful surprise because despite all the backstage drama , this is a movie that tells stories that work -- is charming , is moving , is funny and looks professional . "
neg,"in exactly 89 minutes , most of which passed as slowly as if i'd been sitting naked on an igloo , formula 51 sank from quirky to jerky to utter turkey . "
neg,"if you want a movie time trip , the 1960 version is a far smoother ride . "
pos,the entire movie establishes a wonderfully creepy mood . 
pos,"dazzling in its complexity , disturbing for its extraordinary themes , the piano teacher is a film that defies categorisation . it haunts , horrifies , startles and fascinates ; it is impossible to look away . ah yes , and then there's the music . . . "
neg,"no such thing is sort of a minimalist beauty and the beast , but in this case the beast should definitely get top billing . robert john burke as the monster horns in and steals the show . "
pos,"this is a gorgeous film - vivid with color , music and life . delight your senses and crash this wedding ! "
pos,a gripping documentary that reveals how deep the antagonism lies in war-torn jerusalem . 
pos,this is art paying homage to art . 
pos,"there are no special effects , and no hollywood endings . "
pos,a conventional but heartwarming tale . 
neg,the sweetest thing is expressly for idiots who don't care what kind of sewage they shovel into their mental gullets to simulate sustenance . 
pos, . . . a powerful sequel and one of the best films of the year . 
pos,candid and comfortable ; a film that deftly balances action and reflection as it lets you grasp and feel the passion others have for their work . 
neg,there are now two signs that m . night shyamalan's debut feature sucked up all he has to give to the mystic genres of cinema : unbreakable and signs . 
neg,national lampoon's van wilder could be the worst thing to come out of national lampoon since class reunion
pos,"because the genre is well established , what makes the movie fresh is smart writing , skewed characters , and the title performance by kieran culkin . "
pos,could i have been more geeked when i heard that apollo 13 was going to be released in imax format ? in a word : no . 
pos,"although mainstream american movies tend to exploit the familiar , every once in a while a film arrives from the margin that gives viewers a chance to learn , to grow , to travel . "
neg,[the film's] taste for  shock humor  will wear thin on all but those weaned on the comedy of tom green and the farrelly brothers . 
neg,"a weird little movie that's amusing enough while you watch it , offering fine acting moments and pungent insights into modern l . a . 's show-biz and media subcultures . but it doesn't leave you with much . "
neg,there are just too many characters saying too many clever things and getting into too many pointless situations . where's the movie here ? 
neg,"unspeakable , of course , barely begins to describe the plot and its complications . vulgar is too optimistic a title . "
pos,at once a testament to the divine calling of education and a demonstration of the painstaking process of imparting knowledge . 
pos,"this is as powerful a set of evidence as you'll ever find of why art matters , and how it can resonate far beyond museum walls and through to the most painfully marginal lives . "
pos," . . . creates a visceral sense of its characters' lives and conflicted emotions that carries it far above . . . what could have been a melodramatic , lifetime channel-style anthology . "
pos,"an intelligent , multi-layered and profoundly humanist ( not to mention gently political ) meditation on the values of knowledge , education , and the affects of cultural and geographical displacement . "
neg,"[soderbergh] tends to place most of the psychological and philosophical material in italics rather than trust an audience's intelligence , and he creates an overall sense of brusqueness . "
pos,"coy but exhilarating , with really solid performances by ving rhames and wesley snipes . "
neg, . . . really horrible drek . 
neg,"the movie turns out to be [assayas'] homage to the gallic 'tradition of quality , ' in all its fusty squareness . "
pos,"as surreal as a dream and as detailed as a photograph , as visually dexterous as it is at times imaginatively overwhelming . "
pos,a captivating and intimate study about dying and loving . . . 
pos,it's been made with an innocent yet fervid conviction that our hollywood has all but lost . 
neg,"a laughable -- or rather , unlaughable -- excuse for a film . "
pos,"[drumline] is entertaining for what it does , and admirable for what it doesn't do . "
pos,sum  is jack ryan's  do-over .  give credit to everyone from robinson down to the key grip that this bold move works . especially give credit to affleck . 
pos,a sober and affecting chronicle of the leveling effect of loss . 
pos,much monkeyfun for all . 
neg,feels less like a change in [herzog's] personal policy than a half-hearted fluke . 
pos,"using a stock plot , about a boy injects just enough freshness into the proceedings to provide an enjoyable 100 minutes in a movie theater . "
neg,has all the depth of a wading pool . 
neg,another in-your-face wallow in the lower depths made by people who have never sung those blues . 
neg,so exaggerated and broad that it comes off as annoying rather than charming . 
pos,an unabashedly schmaltzy and thoroughly enjoyable true story . 
pos,the film's welcome breeziness and some unbelievably hilarious moments -- most portraying the idiocy of the film industry -- make it mostly worth the trip . 
pos,the film exudes the urbane sweetness that woody allen seems to have bitterly forsaken . 
pos,"what saves it . . . and makes it one of the better video-game-based flicks , is that the film acknowledges upfront that the plot makes no sense , such that the lack of linearity is the point of emotional and moral departure for protagonist alice . "
pos,the limited sets and small confined and dark spaces also are homages to a classic low-budget film noir movie . 
neg,"the town has kind of an authentic feel , but each one of these people stand out and everybody else is in the background and it just seems manufactured to me and artificial . "
neg,"no matter how firmly director john stainton has his tongue in his cheek , the fact remains that a wacky concept does not a movie make . "
neg,"preposterous and tedious , sonny is spiked with unintentional laughter that , unfortunately , occurs too infrequently to make the film even a guilty pleasure . "
pos,"precocious smarter-than-thou wayward teen struggles to rebel against his oppressive , right-wing , propriety-obsessed family . anyone else seen this before ? "
pos,the son's room is a triumph of gentility that earns its moments of pathos . 
neg,"that neither protagonist has a distinguishable condition hardly matters because both are just actory concoctions , defined by childlike dimness and a handful of quirks . "
neg,"britney's performance cannot be faulted . lucy's a dull girl , that's all . "
neg,"as exciting as all this exoticism might sound to the typical pax viewer , the rest of us will be lulled into a coma . "
pos,"the film's strength isn't in its details , but in the larger picture it paints - of a culture in conflict with itself , with the thin veneer of nationalism that covers our deepest , media-soaked fears . "
pos,"a lean , deftly shot , well-acted , weirdly retro thriller that recalls a raft of '60s and '70s european-set spy pictures . "
neg,"whatever satire lucky break was aiming for , it certainly got lost in the  soon-to-be-forgettable  section of the quirky rip-off prison romp pile . it's petty thievery like this that puts flimsy flicks like this behind bars"
pos,"what the movie lacks in action it more than makes up for in drama , suspense , revenge , and romance . "
pos,light years/ several warp speeds/ levels and levels of dilithium crystals better than the pitiful insurrection . which isn't to say that it's the equal of some of its predecessors . 
neg,"a frustrating 'tweener' -- too slick , contrived and exploitative for the art houses and too cynical , small and decadent for the malls . "
pos,"this new zealand coming-of-age movie isn't really about anything . when it's this rich and luscious , who cares ? "
pos,very predictable but still entertaining
pos,"fast-paced and wonderfully edited , the film is extremely thorough . "
pos,that the real antwone fisher was able to overcome his personal obstacles and become a good man is a wonderful thing ; that he has been able to share his story so compellingly with us is a minor miracle . 
pos,"an undeniably moving film to experience , and ultimately that's what makes it worth a recommendation . "
pos,"[a] wonderfully loopy tale of love , longing , and voting . "
neg,a cinematic sleeping pill of impressive potency . 
neg,"a film really has to be exceptional to justify a three hour running time , and this isn't . "
neg,originality is sorely lacking . 
neg,[a] shapeless blob of desperate entertainment . 
pos,a beautiful and haunting examination of the stories we tell ourselves to make sense of the mundane horrors of the world .

neg,"while howard's appreciation of brown and his writing is clearly well-meaning and sincere , the movie would be impossible to sit through were it not for the supporting cast . "
neg,"in a strange way , egoyan has done too much . he's worked too hard on this movie . "
neg,characters wander into predictably treacherous situations even though they should know better .

neg,there are many definitions of 'time waster' but this movie must surely be one of them . 
neg,there's nothing provocative about this film save for the ways in which it studiously avoids provoking thought .

neg,a film that plays things so nice 'n safe as to often play like a milquetoast movie of the week blown up for the big screen . 
pos,"insomnia does not become one of those rare remakes to eclipse the original , but it doesn't disgrace it , either . "

neg,a standard haunted house tale transplanted to the high seas . 
pos,boomers and their kids will have a barrie good time . 
neg,"instead of accurately accounting a terrible true story , the film's more determined to become the next texas chainsaw massacre . but what about the countless other people who'd merely like to watch a solid tale about a universally interesting soul ? "
neg,"the screenplay , co-written by director imogen kimmel , lacks the wit necessary to fully exploit the comic elements of the premise , making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing . "

neg,a late-night cable sexploitation romp masquerading as a thriller about the ruthless social order that governs college cliques . 
pos,"good car chases , great fight scenes , and a distinctive blend of european , american and asian influences . "
pos,"this film is not a love letter for the slain rappers , it's a taunt -a call for justice for two crimes from which many of us have not yet recovered . "
neg,"despite all evidence to the contrary , this clunker has somehow managed to pose as an actual feature movie , the kind that charges full admission and gets hyped on tv and purports to amuse small children and ostensible adults . "
pos,"it has the charm of the original american road movies , feasting on the gorgeous , ramshackle landscape of the filmmaker's motherland . "
neg,"outside of burger's desire to make some kind of film , it's really unclear why this project was undertaken"
pos,candid camera on methamphetamines . 
neg,overall tomfoolery like this is a matter of taste . 
pos,"' . . . the film's considered approach to its subject matter is too calm and thoughtful for agitprop , and the thinness of its characterizations makes it a failure as straight drama . '"
neg,it's the type of stunt the academy loves : a powerful political message stuffed into an otherwise mediocre film . 
neg,"the animation and backdrops are lush and inventive , yet return to neverland never manages to take us to that elusive , lovely place where we suspend our disbelief . "
neg,"an ambitiously naturalistic , albeit half-baked , drama about an abused , inner-city autistic teen . "
neg,"never quite transcends jokester status . . . and the punchline doesn't live up to barry's dead-eyed , perfectly chilled delivery . "
pos,"not a schlocky creature feature but something far more stylish and cerebral--and , hence , more chillingly effective . "
neg,don't expect any subtlety from this latest entry in the increasingly threadbare gross-out comedy cycle . 
pos,"sure , it's more of the same , but as the film proves , that's not always a bad thing . "
pos,k-19 : the widowmaker is a great yarn . 
neg,what we get . . . is caddyshack crossed with the loyal order of raccoons . 
neg,"in the end , all you can do is admire the ensemble players and wonder what the point of it is . "

pos,polished korean political-action film is just as good -- and bad -- as hollywood action epics . is this progress ? 
pos,but even with the two-wrongs-make-a-right chemistry between jolie and burns . . . this otherwise appealing picture loses its soul to screenwriting for dummies conformity .

neg,this is nothing but familiar territory . 
pos,"hilarious , touching and wonderfully dyspeptic . "
pos,"it's a sweet , laugh-a-minute crowd pleaser that lifts your spirits as well as the corners of your mouth . "
neg,"director ferzan ozpetek creates an interesting dynamic with the members of this group , who live in the same apartment building . but he loses his focus when he concentrates on any single person . "

neg,one groan-inducing familiarity begets another . 
neg,a well acted and well intentioned snoozer . 
neg,"the director knows how to apply textural gloss , but his portrait of sex-as-war is strictly sitcom . "

neg,"at first , the sight of a blind man directing a film is hilarious , but as the film goes on , the joke wears thin . "
pos," . . . enthusiastically invokes the percussion rhythm , the brass soul and the sense of fierce competition that helps make great marching bands half the fun of college football games . "
pos,"rich in atmosphere of the post-war art world , it manages to instruct without reeking of research library dust . "
pos,"with few respites , marshall keeps the energy humming , and his edits , unlike those in moulin rouge , are crisp and purposeful without overdoing it . "

neg,my advice is to skip the film and pick up the soundtrack . 
neg,"a relatively effective little potboiler until its absurd , contrived , overblown , and entirely implausible finale . "
pos,an energetic and engaging film that never pretends to be something it isn't . 
neg,it shows that some studios firmly believe that people have lost the ability to think and will forgive any shoddy product as long as there's a little girl-on-girl action . 
neg,it wouldn't be my preferred way of spending 100 minutes or $7 . 00 . 
neg, . . . the movie is just a plain old monster . 
pos,perhaps the best sports movie i've ever seen . 
neg,suffers from a lack of clarity and audacity that a subject as monstrous and pathetic as dahmer demands . 
neg,the pivotal narrative point is so ripe the film can't help but go soft and stinky . 
neg,like being trapped at a perpetual frat party . . . how can something so gross be so boring ? 
neg,"it's really just another silly hollywood action film , one among a multitude of simple-minded , yahoo-ing death shows . "
neg,"ritchie's treatment of the class reversal is majorly ham-fisted , from the repetitive manifestos that keep getting thrown in people's faces to the fact amber is such a joke . "
neg,too silly to take seriously .

neg,"walter hill's pulpy , stylized boxing melodrama undisputed nearly overcomes its questionable in-the-ring match-up with solid fight choreography and gritty prison authenticity . "

pos,"it's up to you to decide whether to admire these people's dedication to their cause or be repelled by their dogmatism , manipulativeness and narrow , fearful view of american life . "
neg,a movie that harps on media-constructed 'issues' like whether compromise is the death of self… this orgasm [won't be an] exceedingly memorable one for most people . 
pos,this is not a retread of  dead poets' society .  
neg,narc can only remind us of brilliant crime dramas without becoming one itself . 
neg,"his comedy premises are often hackneyed or just plain crude , calculated to provoke shocked laughter , without following up on a deeper level . "
neg,"although the sequel has all the outward elements of the original , the first film's lovely flakiness is gone , replaced by the forced funniness found in the dullest kiddie flicks . "
neg,"such a wildly uneven hit-and-miss enterprise , you can't help suspecting that it was improvised on a day-to-day basis during production . "
pos,"if you ignore the cliches and concentrate on city by the sea's interpersonal drama , it ain't half-bad . "

pos,"an invaluable historical document thanks to the filmmaker's extraordinary access to massoud , whose charm , cultivation and devotion to his people are readily apparent . "
neg,"well made but uninvolving , bloodwork isn't a terrible movie , just a stultifyingly obvious one -- an unrewarding collar for a murder mystery . "
neg,shafer's feature doesn't offer much in terms of plot or acting . 
neg,…the maudlin way its story unfolds suggests a director fighting against the urge to sensationalize his material . 
neg,obvious politics and rudimentary animation reduce the chances that the appeal of hey arnold ! the movie will reach far beyond its core demographic . 
neg,hip-hop rarely comes alive as its own fire-breathing entity in this picture . 
pos,"an energetic , violent movie with a momentum that never lets up . "
neg,"this mild-mannered farce , directed by one of its writers , john c . walsh , is corny in a way that bespeaks an expiration date passed a long time ago . "

neg,"if this holiday movie is supposed to be a gift , somebody unwrapped it early , took out all the good stuff , and left behind the crap ( literally ) . "
neg,"a long-winded , predictable scenario . "
pos, . . . a trashy little bit of fluff stuffed with enjoyable performances and a bewildering sense of self-importance
neg,the movie's heavy-handed screenplay navigates a fast fade into pomposity and pretentiousness . 
neg,i couldn't help but feel the wasted potential of this slapstick comedy . 
pos,it's hard to imagine alan arkin being better than he is in this performance . 
neg,"there is one surefire way to get a nomination for a best-foreign-film oscar : make a movie about whimsical folk who learn a nonchallenging , life-affirming lesson while walking around a foreign city with stunning architecture . "
pos,hoffman's performance is authentic to the core of his being . 
neg,a bit of an unwieldy mess . 
pos,a cop story that understands the medium amazingly well . 
neg,"this pep-talk for faith , hope and charity does little to offend , but if saccharine earnestness were a crime , the film's producers would be in the clink for life . "
pos,begins like a docu-drama but builds its multi-character story with a flourish . 
neg,the film didn't convince me that calvin jr . 's barbershop represents some sort of beacon of hope in the middle of chicago's south side . 
pos,"my big fat greek wedding is that rare animal known as 'a perfect family film , ' because it's about family . "
neg,i watched the brainless insanity of no such thing with mounting disbelief . 
pos,"you can feel the heat that ignites this gripping tale , and the humor and humanity that root it in feeling . "
neg,"a perfect example of rancid , well-intentioned , but shamelessly manipulative movie making . "
neg,"it's another video movie photographed like a film , with the bad lighting that's often written off as indie film naturalism . "
pos,eyre is on his way to becoming the american indian spike lee . 
neg,how much you are moved by the emotional tumult of [françois and michèle's] relationship depends a lot on how interesting and likable you find them . 
pos,buy popcorn . take nothing seriously and enjoy the ride . 
neg,"while it is welcome to see a chinese film depict a homosexual relationship in a mature and frank fashion , lan yu never catches dramatic fire . "
neg,clayburgh and tambor are charming performers ; neither of them deserves eric schaeffer . 
neg,'this movie sucks . '
pos,"a mess , but it's a sincere mess . "
pos,"the movie is well crafted , and well executed . if you're paying attention , the  big twists  are pretty easy to guess - but that doesn't make the movie any less entertaining . "
neg,despite some gulps the film is a fuzzy huggy . 
neg,been there done that . 
pos,is this love or is it masochism ? binoche makes it interesting trying to find out . 
pos,"like the rugrats movies , the wild thornberrys movie doesn't offer much more than the series , but its emphasis on caring for animals and respecting other cultures is particularly welcome . "
pos,"the film delivers what it promises : a look at the  wild ride  that ensues when brash young men set out to conquer the online world with laptops , cell phones and sketchy business plans . "
pos,"for the most part , the film does hold up pretty well . "
neg,"dissing a bond movie is quite like calling a dog stupid , but when it has the temerity to run over two hours , you feel like winding up with a kick . "
pos,"grenier is terrific , bringing an unforced , rapid-fire delivery to toback's heidegger- and nietzsche-referencing dialogue . "
pos,another entertaining romp from robert rodriguez . 
pos,[breheny's] lensing of the new zealand and cook island locations captures both the beauty of the land and the people . 
pos,"a droll , well-acted , character-driven comedy with unexpected deposits of feeling . "
pos,"it does give a taste of the burning man ethos , an appealing blend of counter-cultural idealism and hedonistic creativity . "
pos,a reasonably entertaining sequel to 1994's surprise family hit that may strain adult credibility . 
neg,how i killed my father is one of those art house films that makes you feel like you're watching an iceberg melt -- only it never melts . 
pos,until its final minutes this is a perceptive study of two families in crisis -- and of two girls whose friendship is severely tested by bad luck and their own immaturity . 
pos,"ultimately ,  mib ii  succeeds due to its rapid-fire delivery and enough inspired levity that it can't be dismissed as mindless . "
pos,"like the film's almost anthropologically detailed realization of early-'80s suburbia , it's significant without being overstated . "
pos,"it has the ability to offend and put off everyone , but it holds you with its outrageousness . "
neg,the film's stagecrafts are intimate and therefore bolder than the otherwise calculated artifice that defines and overwhelms the film's production design . 
neg,"sadly , though many of the actors throw off a spark or two when they first appear , they can't generate enough heat in this cold vacuum of a comedy to start a reaction . "
pos,"over the years , hollywood has crafted a solid formula for successful animated movies , and ice age only improves on it , with terrific computer graphics , inventive action sequences and a droll sense of humor . "
neg,was that movie nothing more than a tepid exercise in trotting out a formula that worked five years ago but has since lost its fizz ? 
pos,there's nothing more satisfying during a summer of event movies than a spy thriller like the bourne identity that's packed with just as much intelligence as action . 
pos,gets under the skin of a man who has just lost his wife . 
pos,a haunting tale of murder and mayhem . 
neg,nothing about the film -- with the possible exception of elizabeth hurley's breasts -- is authentic . 
pos,"wilco fans will have a great time , and the movie should win the band a few new converts , too . "
neg,"when the first few villians are introduced as  spider  and  snake  you know you're in for a real winner , creativity at its peak . "
neg,"goldbacher draws on an elegant visual sense and a talent for easy , seductive pacing . . . but she and writing partner laurence coriat don't manage an equally assured narrative coinage . "
neg,master of disguise runs for only 71 minutes and feels like three hours . 
pos,"most consumers of lo mein and general tso's chicken barely give a thought to the folks who prepare and deliver it , so , hopefully , this film will attach a human face to all those little steaming cartons . "
neg,"the sum of all fears pretends to be a serious exploration of nuclear terrorism , but it's really nothing more than warmed-over cold war paranoia . "
pos,"there are a couple of things that elevate  glory  above most of its ilk , most notably the mere presence of duvall . "
neg,little is done to support the premise other than fling gags at it to see which ones shtick . 
neg,a sometimes incisive and sensitive portrait that is undercut by its awkward structure and a final veering toward melodrama . 
pos,"murderous maids has a lot going for it , not least the brilliant performances by testud . . . and parmentier . "
neg,the only thing  swept away  is the one hour and thirty-three minutes spent watching this waste of time . 
pos,"it might be 'easier' to watch on video at home , but that shouldn't stop die-hard french film connoisseurs from going out and enjoying the big-screen experience . "
neg,this is a movie so insecure about its capacity to excite that it churns up not one but two flagrantly fake thunderstorms to underscore the action . 
neg,"i can't begin to tell you how tedious , how resolutely unamusing , how thoroughly unrewarding all of this is , and what a reckless squandering of four fine acting talents . . . "
pos,several degrees shy of the gross-out contests one expects from current teen fare . 
neg,this dreadfully earnest inversion of the concubine love triangle eschews the previous film's historical panorama and roiling pathos for bug-eyed mugging and gay-niche condescension . 
pos,"with an expressive face reminiscent of gong li and a vivid personality like zhang ziyi's , dong stakes out the emotional heart of happy . "
neg,"for all of its insights into the dream world of teen life , and its electronic expression through cyber culture , the film gives no quarter to anyone seeking to pull a cohesive story out of its 2 1/2-hour running time . "
pos,"the pinochet case is a searing album of remembrance from those who , having survived , suffered most . "
neg,one just waits grimly for the next shock without developing much attachment to the characters . 
neg,starts out ballsy and stylish but fails to keep it up and settles into clichés . 
pos,a savage john waters-like humor that dances on the edge of tastelessness without ever quite falling over . 
pos,it's the filmmakers' post-camp comprehension of what made old-time b movies good-bad that makes eight legged freaks a perfectly entertaining summer diversion . 
neg,nothing more than four or five mild chuckles surrounded by 86 minutes of overly-familiar and poorly-constructed comedy . 
pos,"gangster no . 1 is solid , satisfying fare for adults . "
neg,under-rehearsed and lifeless
pos,"if it's possible for a sequel to outshine the original , then sl2 does just that . "
pos," . . . only bond can save us from the latest eccentric , super-wealthy megalomaniac bent on world domination and destruction . "
pos,"never mind whether you buy the stuff about barris being a cia hit man . the kooky yet shadowy vision clooney sustains throughout is daring , inventive and impressive . "
pos,"as a director , paxton is surprisingly brilliant , deftly sewing together what could have been a confusing and horrifying vision into an intense and engrossing head-trip . "
neg,everyone's to blame here . 
pos,"preaches to two completely different choirs at the same time , which is a pretty amazing accomplishment . "
neg,an awkward and indigestible movie . 
neg,you cannot guess why the cast and crew didn't sign a pact to burn the negative and the script and pretend the whole thing never existed . 
pos,"a hip ride into hyper-time , clockstoppers is a lively and enjoyable adventure for all ages at any time . "
neg,starts as an intense political and psychological thriller but is sabotaged by ticking time bombs and other hollywood-action cliches . 
neg,those unfamiliar with mormon traditions may find the singles ward occasionally bewildering . 
pos,"this film seems thirsty for reflection , itself taking on adolescent qualities . "
pos,"escapes the precious trappings of most romantic comedies , infusing into the story very real , complicated emotions . "
neg,what starts off as a potentially incredibly twisting mystery becomes simply a monster chase film . 
pos,"all right , so it's not a brilliant piece of filmmaking , but it is a funny ( sometimes hilarious ) comedy with a deft sense of humor about itself , a playful spirit and a game cast . "
pos,"a resonant tale of racism , revenge and retribution . "
neg,what you end up getting is the vertical limit of surfing movies - memorable stunts with lots of downtime in between . 
pos,life on the rez is no picnic : this picture shows you why . 
pos,"efficient , suitably anonymous chiller . "
neg,"if this is cinema , i pledge allegiance to cagney and lacey . "
neg,ice age posits a heretofore unfathomable question : is it possible for computer-generated characters to go through the motions ? 
neg,murder and mayhem of this sort quickly becomes monotonous . 
neg,it's surprisingly bland despite the heavy doses of weird performances and direction . 
neg,sushi for the connoisseurs of the macabre . 
neg,thin period piece . 
pos,"the film fits into a genre that has been overexposed , redolent of a thousand cliches , and yet remains uniquely itself , vibrant with originality . "
neg,"all movie long , city by the sea swings from one approach to the other , but in the end , it stays in formula -- which is a waste of de niro , mcdormand and the other good actors in the cast . "
neg,a seriously bad film with seriously warped logic by writer-director kurt wimmer at the screenplay level . 
pos,it finds its moviegoing pleasures in the tiny events that could make a person who has lived her life half-asleep suddenly wake up and take notice . 
pos,"yes , it's as good as you remember . in fact , even better . "
pos,viewers of  the ring  are more likely to remember the haunting images than the plot holes . 
neg,"jam-packed with literally bruising jokes . every five minutes or so , someone gets clocked . "
neg,what happened with pluto nash ? how did it ever get made ? 
pos,"a different and emotionally reserved type of survival story -- a film less about refracting all of world war ii through the specific conditions of one man , and more about that man lost in its midst . "
neg,"though her fans will assuredly have their funny bones tickled , others will find their humor-seeking dollars best spent elsewhere . "
neg,the only reason you should see this movie is if you have a case of masochism and an hour and a half to blow . 
pos," . . . a visually seductive , unrepentantly trashy take on rice's second installment of her vampire chronicles . "
neg,"some of the computer animation is handsome , and various amusing sidekicks add much-needed levity to the otherwise bleak tale , but overall the film never rises above mediocrity . "
pos,"the trinity assembly approaches the endeavor with a shocking lack of irony , and george ratliff's documentary , hell house , reflects their earnestness — which makes for a terrifying film . "
neg,a bland animated sequel that hardly seems worth the effort . 
neg,"though the book runs only about 300 pages , it is so densely packed . . . that even an ambitious adaptation and elaborate production like mr . schepisi's seems skimpy and unclear . "
neg,"it leers , offering next to little insight into its intriguing subject . "
neg, . . . a weak and ineffective ghost story without a conclusion or pay off . 
neg,"the acting is stiff , the story lacks all trace of wit , the sets look like they were borrowed from gilligan's island -- and the cgi scooby might well be the worst special-effects creation of the year . "
pos,my wife is an actress works as well as it does because [the leads] are such a companionable couple . 
neg,too much of the humor falls flat . 
neg,becomes a bit of a mishmash : a tearjerker that doesn't and a thriller that won't . 
neg,the leads we are given here are simply too bland to be interesting . 
pos,"witty , touching and well paced . "
neg,the film has a childlike quality about it . but the feelings evoked in the film are lukewarm and quick to pass . 
neg,there's more scatological action in 8 crazy nights than a proctologist is apt to encounter in an entire career . 
pos,one scarcely needs the subtitles to enjoy this colorful action farce . 
neg,it's disappointing when filmmakers throw a few big-name actors and cameos at a hokey script . 
pos,"whether our action-and-popcorn obsessed culture will embrace this engaging and literate psychodrama isn't much of a mystery , unfortunately . "
neg,"i like it . no , i hate it . no , i love it . . . hell , i dunno . "
neg,"my reaction in a word : disappointment . his last movie was poetically romantic and full of indelible images , but his latest has nothing going for it . "
neg,the crassness of this reactionary thriller is matched only by the ridiculousness of its premise . 
pos,"the animated subplot keenly depicts the inner struggles of our adolescent heroes - insecure , uncontrolled , and intense . "
neg,"definitely in the guilty pleasure b-movie category , reign of fire is so incredibly inane that it is laughingly enjoyable . "
neg,"without shakespeare's eloquent language , the update is dreary and sluggish . "
pos,"renner's performance as dahmer is unforgettable , deeply absorbing . "
pos,evokes the style and flash of the double-cross that made mamet's  house of games  and last fall's  heist  so much fun . 
pos,a wildly entertaining scan of evans' career . 
neg,nothing more than an amiable but unfocused bagatelle that plays like a loosely-connected string of acting-workshop exercises . 
neg,"it's not exactly worth the bucks to expend the full price for a date , but when it comes out on video , it's well worth a rental . "
neg,diane lane's sophisticated performance can't rescue adrian lyne's unfaithful from its sleazy moralizing . 
neg,"a real clunker . a well-made , thoughtful , well-acted clunker , but a clunker nonetheless . "
neg,an alternately raucous and sappy ethnic sitcom . . . you'd be wise to send your regrets . 
neg,buries an interesting storyline about morality and the choices we make underneath such a mountain of clichés and borrowed images that it might more accurately be titled mr . chips off the old block . 
neg,"features nonsensical and laughable plotting , wooden performances , ineptly directed action sequences and some of the worst dialogue in recent memory . "
neg,no way i can believe this load of junk . 
neg,"'ejemplo de una cinta en que no importa el talento de su reparto o lo interesante que pudo haber resultado su premisa , pues el resultado es francamente aburrido y , por momentos , deplorable . '"
pos,"a teasing drama whose relentless good-deed/bad-deed reversals are just interesting enough to make a sinner like me pray for an even more interesting , less symmetrical , less obviously cross-shaped creation . "
neg,a rambling ensemble piece with loosely connected characters and plots that never quite gel . 
neg,a characteristically engorged and sloppy coming-of-age movie . 
pos,jeffs has created a breathtakingly assured and stylish work of spare dialogue and acute expressiveness . 
neg,spy-vs . -spy action flick with antonio banderas and lucy liu never comes together . 
neg,the 50-something lovebirds are too immature and unappealing to care about . 
neg,"the thriller side of this movie is falling flat , as the stalker doesn't do much stalking , and no cop or lawyer grasps the concept of actually investigating the case . "
pos,a screenplay more ingeniously constructed than  memento  
neg,"call me a cynic , but there's something awfully deadly about any movie with a life-affirming message . "
neg,"any reasonably creative eighth-grader could have written a more credible script , though with the same number of continuity errors . "
neg,"just consider what new best friend does not have , beginning with the minor omission of a screenplay . "
pos,"light , silly , photographed with colour and depth , and rather a good time . "
neg,this thing works on no level whatsoever for me . 
neg,deuces wild is an encyclopedia of cliches that shoplifts shamelessly from farewell-to-innocence movies like the wanderers and a bronx tale without cribbing any of their intelligence . 
neg,propelled not by characters but by caricatures . 
neg,"shamelessly sappy and , worse , runs away from its own provocative theme . "
pos,"while this has the making of melodrama , the filmmaker cuts against this natural grain , producing a work that's more interested in asking questions than in answering them . "
neg,plays like some corny television production from a bygone era
pos,"it is risky , intelligent , romantic and rapturous from start to finish . "
neg,"the boys' sparring , like the succession of blows dumped on guei , wears down the story's more cerebral , and likable , plot elements . "
neg,the film thrusts the inchoate but already eldritch christian right propaganda machine into national media circles . 
neg,"as a movie , it never seems fresh and vital . it never plays as dramatic even when dramatic things happen to people . it labours as storytelling . "

pos,"if you're looking for an intelligent movie in which you can release your pent up anger , enough is just the ticket you need . "
neg,"it's not that kung pow isn't funny some of the time -- it just isn't any funnier than bad martial arts movies are all by themselves , without all oedekerk's impish augmentation . "
pos,"the heightened symmetry of this new/old cinema paradiso makes the film a fuller experience , like an old friend haunted by the exigencies of time . "
pos,"the whole mildly pleasant outing -- the r rating is for brief nudity and a grisly corpse -- remains aloft not on its own self-referential hot air , but on the inspired performance of tim allen . "

pos,"[fiji diver rusi vulakoro and the married couple howard and michelle hall] show us the world they love and make us love it , too . "
pos,lovely and poignant . puts a human face on a land most westerners are unfamiliar with . 
neg,"though it pretends to expose the life of male hustlers , it's exploitive without being insightful . "
neg,"even the imaginative gore can't hide the musty scent of todd farmer's screenplay , which is a simple retread of the 1979 alien , with a plucky heroine battling a monster loose in a spaceship . "

neg,strangely comes off as a kingdom more mild than wild .

pos,"  red dragon  is entertaining . an obvious copy of one of the best films ever made , how could it not be ? but it is entertaining on an inferior level . it is a popcorn film , not a must-own , or even a must-see . "
neg,"unfortunately , heartbreak hospital wants to convey the same kind of haughtiness in its own sketchy material but this territory has already been explored previously with better aplomb and sardonic wit . "

pos,what sets this romantic comedy apart from most hollywood romantic comedies is its low-key way of tackling what seems like done-to-death material . 
pos,"mcgrath has deftly trimmed dickens' wonderfully sprawling soap opera , the better to focus on the hero's odyssey from cowering poverty to courage and happiness . "
neg,new best friend shouldn't have gone straight to video ; it should have gone straight to a mystery science theater 3000 video .

neg,a semi-autobiographical film that's so sloppily written and cast that you cannot believe anyone more central to the creation of bugsy than the caterer had anything to do with it .

pos,"amy and matthew have a bit of a phony relationship , but the film works in spite of it . "
pos,"this is a very ambitious project for a fairly inexperienced filmmaker , but good actors , good poetry and good music help sustain it . "

neg,exploitative and largely devoid of the depth or sophistication that would make watching such a graphic treatment of the crimes bearable . 
neg,a terrible movie that some people will nevertheless find moving . 
pos,"based on dave barry's popular book of the same name , the movie benefits from having a real writer plot out all of the characters' moves and overlapping story . "
pos,"it's a smart , funny look at an arcane area of popular culture , and if it isn't entirely persuasive , it does give exposure to some talented performers . "
pos,"all comedy is subversive , but this unrelenting bleak insistence on opting out of any opportunity for finding meaning in relationships or work just becomes sad . "

neg,the master of disguise is awful . it's pauly shore awful . don't say you weren't warned . 
pos,the film is predictable in the reassuring manner of a beautifully sung holiday carol . 
neg,"the director and her capable cast appear to be caught in a heady whirl of new age-inspired good intentions , but the spell they cast isn't the least bit mesmerizing . "
pos,a properly spooky film about the power of spirits to influence us whether we believe in them or not . 
neg,this thing is virtually unwatchable . 
pos,"even though we know the outcome , the seesawing of the general's fate in the arguments of competing lawyers has the stomach-knotting suspense of a legal thriller , while the testimony of witnesses lends the film a resonant undertone of tragedy . "
pos,"world traveler might not go anywhere new , or arrive anyplace special , but it's certainly an honest attempt to get at something . "
pos,"there is a certain sense of experimentation and improvisation to this film that may not always work , but it is nevertheless compelling . "
neg,"they presume their audience won't sit still for a sociology lesson , however entertainingly presented , so they trot out the conventional science-fiction elements of bug-eyed monsters and futuristic women in skimpy clothes . "
neg,"much like robin williams , death to smoochy has already reached its expiration date . "
neg,"[screenwriter] pimental took the farrelly brothers comedy and feminized it , but it is a rather poor imitation . "
neg,collapses under its own meager weight . 
pos,"the old-world- meets-new mesh is incarnated in the movie's soundtrack , a joyful effusion of disco bollywood that , by the end of monsoon wedding , sent my spirit soaring out of the theater . "
pos,"tully is worth a look for its true-to-life characters , its sensitive acting , its unadorned view of rural life and the subtle direction of first-timer hilary birmingham . "
neg,on the right track to something that's creepy and effective . . . it's just going to take more than a man in a bullwinkle costume to get there . 
pos,exciting documentary . 
pos,"about schmidt is nicholson's goofy , heartfelt , mesmerizing king lear . "
neg,so brisk is wang's pacing that none of the excellent cast are given air to breathe . 
neg,too lazy to take advantage of its semi-humorous premise . 
pos,"a creepy , intermittently powerful study of a self-destructive man . . . about as unsettling to watch as an exploratory medical procedure or an autopsy . "
pos,the 1960s rebellion was misdirected : you can't fight your culture . 
pos,"o fantasma is boldly , confidently orchestrated , aesthetically and sexually , and its impact is deeply and rightly disturbing . "
pos,the film has the courage of its convictions and excellent performances on its side . 
neg,"for each chuckle there are at least 10 complete misses , many coming from the amazingly lifelike tara reid , whose acting skills are comparable to a cardboard cutout . "
neg,the narrative is so consistently unimaginative that probably the only way to have saved the film is with the aid of those wisecracking mystery science theater 3000 guys . 
neg,a dark comedy that goes for sick and demented humor simply to do so . the movie is without intent . 
neg," . . . unspeakably , unbearably dull , featuring reams of flatly delivered dialogue and a heroine who comes across as both shallow and dim-witted . "

neg,"halfway through , however , having sucked dry the undead action flick formula , blade ii mutates into a gross-out monster movie with effects that are more silly than scary . "
neg,"when the film ended , i felt tired and drained and wanted to lie on my own deathbed for a while . "
neg,"after a while , hoffman's quirks and mannerisms , particularly his penchant for tearing up on cue -- things that seem so real in small doses -- become annoying and artificial . "
pos,"stands as one of the year's most intriguing movie experiences , letting its imagery speak for it while it forces you to ponder anew what a movie can be . "
neg,"one problem with the movie , directed by joel schumacher , is that it jams too many prefabricated story elements into the running time . "
neg,"swinging , the film makes it seem , is not a hobby that attracts the young and fit . or intelligent . "
neg,"silly , loud and goofy . "
pos,tuck everlasting achieves a delicate balance of romantic innocence and philosophical depth .

pos,its director's most substantial feature for some time . 
pos,"like kissing jessica stein , amy's orgasm has a key strength in its willingness to explore its principal characters with honesty , insight and humor . "
neg,"just a kiss wants desperately to come off as a fanciful film about the typical problems of average people . but it is set in a world that is very , very far from the one most of us inhabit . "
neg,a dramatic comedy as pleasantly dishonest and pat as any hollywood fluff . 
neg,director oliver parker labors so hard to whip life into the importance of being earnest that he probably pulled a muscle or two . 
neg,heavy with flabby rolls of typical toback machinations . 
neg,such a bad movie that its luckiest viewers will be seated next to one of those ignorant pinheads who talk throughout the show . 
pos,cho's latest comic set isn't as sharp or as fresh as i'm the one that i want . . . but it's still damn funny stuff . 
neg,we haven't seen such hilarity since say it isn't so ! 
neg, . . . its stupidities wind up sticking in one's mind a lot more than the cool bits . 
neg,it's hard to understand why anyone in his right mind would even think to make the attraction a movie . and it's harder still to believe that anyone in his right mind would want to see the it . 
pos,its rawness and vitality give it considerable punch . 
pos,"both lead performances are oscar-size . quaid is utterly fearless as the tortured husband living a painful lie , and moore wonderfully underplays the long-suffering heroine with an unflappable '50s dignity somewhere between jane wyman and june cleaver . "

neg,all i can say is fuhgeddaboutit . 
pos,"the whole cast looks to be having so much fun with the slapstick antics and silly street patois , tossing around obscure expressions like bellini and mullinski , that the compact 86 minutes breezes by . "

pos,a well-made and often lovely depiction of the mysteries of friendship . 
neg,"a little too ponderous to work as shallow entertainment , not remotely incisive enough to qualify as drama , monsoon wedding serves mostly to whet one's appetite for the bollywood films . "
neg,"after a while , the only way for a reasonably intelligent person to get through the country bears is to ponder how a whole segment of pop-music history has been allowed to get wet , fuzzy and sticky . "

neg,"this is sandler running on empty , repeating what he's already done way too often . "

pos,"a first-class , thoroughly involving b movie that effectively combines two surefire , beloved genres -- the prison flick and the fight film . "
pos,"[taymor] utilizes the idea of making kahlo's art a living , breathing part of the movie , often catapulting the artist into her own work . this isn't a new idea . it's been done before but never so vividly or with so much passion . "
neg,none of this is half as moving as the filmmakers seem to think .

neg,you may be galled that you've wasted nearly two hours of your own precious life with this silly little puddle of a movie . 
neg,"an appalling 'ace ventura' rip-off that somehow manages to bring together kevin pollak , former wrestler chyna and dolly parton . if any of them list this 'credit' on their resumes in the future , that'll be much funnier than anything in the film . . . "
neg,"few of the increasingly far-fetched events that first-time writer-director neil burger follows up with are terribly convincing , which is a pity , considering barry's terrific performance . "
neg,"like a medium-grade network sitcom--mostly inoffensive , fitfully amusing , but ultimately so weightless that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen . "
pos,jackson and co have brought back the value and respect for the term epic cinema . 
pos,a soul-stirring documentary about the israeli/palestinian conflict as revealed through the eyes of some children who remain curious about each other against all odds . 
neg,"the film doesn't have enough innovation or pizazz to attract teenagers , and it lacks the novel charm that made spy kids a surprising winner with both adults and younger audiences . "
neg,"a gratingly unfunny groaner littered with zero-dimensional , unlikable characters and hackneyed , threadbare comic setups . "
neg,"the overall feel of the film is pretty cheesy , but there's still a real sense that the star trek tradition has been honored as best it can , given the embarrassing script and weak direction . "
neg,this goofy gangster yarn never really elevates itself from being yet another earnestly generic crime-busting comic vehicle -- a well-intentioned remake that shows some spunk and promise but fails to register as anything distinctive or daring
neg,"it's really yet another anemic and formulaic lethal weapon-derived buddy-cop movie , trying to pass off its lack of imagination as hip knowingness . "
neg,"scooby dooby doo / and shaggy too / you both look and sound great . / but daphne , you're too buff / fred thinks he's tough / and velma - wow , you've lost weight ! "

neg,a singularly off-putting romantic comedy . 
neg,return to neverland manages to straddle the line between another classic for the company and just another run-of-the-mill disney sequel intended for the home video market .

pos,"a cultural wildcard experience : wacky , different , unusual , even nutty . "
pos,"the direction has a fluid , no-nonsense authority , and the performances by harris , phifer and cam'ron seal the deal . "
neg,"there are many things that solid acting can do for a movie , but crafting something promising from a mediocre screenplay is not one of them . "

neg," . . . for all its social and political potential , state property doesn't end up being very inspiring or insightful . "
pos,jones . . . does offer a brutal form of charisma . 
neg,a cheap scam put together by some cynical creeps at revolution studios and imagine entertainment to make the suckers out there surrender $9 and 93 minutes of unrecoverable life . 
pos,"poignant and moving , a walk to remember is an inspirational love story , capturing the innocence and idealism of that first encounter . "
neg,"belongs in the too-hot-for-tv direct-to-video/dvd category , and this is why i have given it a one-star rating . "
neg,needed a little less bling-bling and a lot more romance . 
pos,"one of the most original american productions this year , you'll find yourself remembering this refreshing visit to a sunshine state . "
pos,"nair doesn't use [monsoon wedding] to lament the loss of culture . instead , she sees it as a chance to revitalize what is and always has been remarkable about clung-to traditions . "
pos,paid in full is remarkably engaging despite being noticeably derivative of goodfellas and at least a half dozen other trouble-in-the-ghetto flicks . 
neg,"thirty years ago , it would have been groundbreaking . now it's just tired . "
pos,"open-ended and composed of layer upon layer , talk to her is a cinephile's feast , an invitation to countless interpretations . "

neg,"fessenden has nurtured his metaphors at the expense of his narrative , but he does display an original talent . "
neg,"the explosion essentially ruined -- or , rather , overpowered -- the fiction of the movie for me . "
pos,a sly dissection of the inanities of the contemporary music business and a rather sad story of the difficulties of artistic collaboration . 
neg,"certainly beautiful to look at , but its not very informative about its titular character and no more challenging than your average television biopic . "

pos,"it's jagger's bone-dry , mournfully brittle delivery that gives the film its bittersweet bite . "
pos,the reason this picture works better than its predecessors is that myers is no longer simply spoofing the mini-mod-madness of '60s spy movies . 
neg,"if you've ever entertained the notion of doing what the title of this film implies , what sex with strangers actually shows may put you off the idea forever . "
pos,ali's graduation from little screen to big is far less painful than his opening scene encounter with an over-amorous terrier .

pos,"an extremely funny , ultimately heartbreaking look at life in contemporary china . "
neg,there's plenty of style in guillermo del toro's sequel to the 1998 hit but why do we need 117 minutes to tell a tale that simply can't sustain more than 90 minutes . 
pos,"despite the film's bizarre developments , hoffman keeps us riveted with every painful nuance , unexpected flashes of dark comedy and the character's gripping humanity . "
neg,the film apparently takes place in a fantasy world where people in hotel hallways recite poetry in voice-over instead of speaking to each other .

pos,"payne constructs a hilarious ode to middle america and middle age with this unlikely odyssey , featuring a pathetic , endearing hero who is all too human . "
neg,the movie is obviously a labour of love so howard appears to have had free rein to be as pretentious as he wanted . 
pos,the script by david koepp is perfectly serviceable and because he gives the story some soul . . . he elevates the experience to a more mythic level . 
pos,it's fairly solid--not to mention well edited so that it certainly doesn't feel like a film that strays past the two and a half mark . 
pos,"writer-director david jacobson and his star , jeremy renner , have made a remarkable film that explores the monster's psychology not in order to excuse him but rather to demonstrate that his pathology evolved from human impulses that grew hideously twisted . "
neg,goes on and on to the point of nausea . 
pos,you will emerge with a clearer view of how the gears of justice grind on and the death report comes to share airtime alongside the farm report . 
pos," . . . a joke at once flaky and resonant , lightweight and bizarrely original . "
pos,"just as the recent argentine film son of the bride reminded us that a feel-good movie can still show real heart , time of favor presents us with an action movie that actually has a brain . "

pos,"it's a good film , but it falls short of its aspiration to be a true 'epic' . "
pos,"a naturally funny film , home movie makes you crave chris smith's next movie . "

neg, . . . liotta is put in an impossible spot because his character's deceptions ultimately undo him and the believability of the entire scenario . too bad . 
pos, . . . a poignant and powerful narrative that reveals that reading writing and arithmetic are not the only subjects to learn in life .

neg,"bang ! zoom ! it's actually pretty funny , but in all the wrong places . "
neg,"when it's all wet , blue crush is highly enjoyable . when it's on dry land , though , this surfer-girl melodrama starts gasping like a beached grouper . "
neg,"the actors are appealing , but elysian fields is idiotic and absurdly sentimental . "
pos,"because the film deliberately lacks irony , it has a genuine dramatic impact ; it plays like a powerful 1957 drama we've somehow never seen before . "
neg,a didactic and dull documentary glorifying software anarchy . 
pos,norton holds the film together .

pos,"its compelling mix of trial movie , escape movie and unexpected fable ensures the film never feels draggy . "
neg,extremely bad . 
pos,the wanton slipperiness of * corpus and its amiable jerking and reshaping of physical time and space would make it a great piece to watch with kids and use to introduce video as art . 
pos,"ramsay , as in ratcatcher , remains a filmmaker with an acid viewpoint and a real gift for teasing chilly poetry out of lives and settings that might otherwise seem drab and sordid . "
pos,"schaeffer isn't in this film , which may be why it works as well as it does . "
pos,"not a cozy or ingratiating work , but it's challenging , sometimes clever , and always interesting , and those are reasons enough to see it . "

pos,"ranging from funny to shattering and featuring some of the year's best acting , personal velocity gathers plenty of dramatic momentum . "
pos,"bennett's naturalistic performance speaks volumes more truth than any 'reality' show , and anybody contemplating their own drastic life changes should watch some body first . "
neg,what can one say about a balding 50-year-old actor playing an innocent boy carved from a log ? 
neg,"makes for some truly odd , at times confusing , kids entertainment . . . but at least this time there's some centered storytelling to go along with all the weird stuff . "

neg,de niro cries . you'll cry for your money back . 
neg,it's too interested in jerking off in all its byzantine incarnations to bother pleasuring its audience . 
neg,the movie does such an excellent job of critiquing itself at every faltering half-step of its development that criticizing feels more like commiserating . 
pos,an intelligently made ( and beautifully edited ) picture that at the very least has a spark of life to it -- more than you can say for plenty of movies that flow through the hollywood pipeline without a hitch .

neg,eight legged freaks ? no big hairy deal . 
pos,enriched by a strong and unforced supporting cast . 
neg,the film tries too hard to be funny and tries too hard to be hip . the end result is a film that's neither .

pos,"morvern callar confirms lynne ramsay as an important , original talent in international cinema . "
pos,"the vivid lead performances sustain interest and empathy , but the journey is far more interesting than the final destination . "
neg,"despite its sincere acting , signs is just another unoriginal run of the mill sci-fi film with a flimsy ending and lots of hype . "
pos,but this is not a movie about an inhuman monster ; it's about a very human one . 
neg,isn't it a bit early in his career for director barry sonnenfeld to do a homage to himself ? and it's a lousy one at that . 
neg,borrows from so many literary and cinematic sources that this future world feels absolutely deja vu . 
neg,a science-fiction pastiche so lacking in originality that if you stripped away its inspirations there would be precious little left . 
neg,"it's not a bad plot ; but , unfortunately , the movie is nowhere near as refined as all the classic dramas it borrows from . "
neg,city by the sea is a gritty police thriller with all the dysfunctional family dynamics one could wish for . but how it washed out despite all of that is the project's prime mystery . 
pos,a refreshing change from the usual whoopee-cushion effort aimed at the youth market . 
pos," . . . an otherwise intense , twist-and-turn thriller that certainly shouldn't hurt talented young gaghan's resume . "
neg,"the screenplay sabotages the movie's strengths at almost every juncture . all the characters are stereotypes , and their interaction is numbingly predictable . "
pos,"that storytelling has value cannot be denied . not even solondz's thirst for controversy , sketchy characters and immature provocations can fully succeed at cheapening it . "
neg,too slick and manufactured to claim street credibility . 
neg,as inept as big-screen remakes of the avengers and the wild wild west . 
pos,a well-rounded tribute to a man whose achievements -- and complexities -- reached far beyond the end zone . 
neg,let's hope -- shall we ? -- that the 'true story' by which all the queen's men is allegedly  inspired  was a lot funnier and more deftly enacted than what's been cobbled together onscreen . 
pos,"this delicately observed story , deeply felt and masterfully stylized , is a triumph for its maverick director . "

pos,"stands as a document of what it felt like to be a new yorker -- or , really , to be a human being -- in the weeks after 9/11 . "
pos,"the stripped-down dramatic constructs , austere imagery and abstract characters are equal parts poetry and politics , obvious at times but evocative and heartfelt . "
pos,"viewed on its own terms , treasure planet is better-than-average family entertainment , but true fans of the stevenson's novel will likely prefer disney's more faithful 1950 live-action swashbuckling classic . "
pos,"laced with liberal doses of dark humor , gorgeous exterior photography , and a stable-full of solid performances , no such thing is a fascinating little tale . "
neg,"every bit as bogus as most disney live action family movies are -- no real plot , no real conflict , no real point . "
pos,i love the way that it took chances and really asks you to take these great leaps of faith and pays off . 
pos,"for most of its footage , the new thriller proves that director m . night shyamalan can weave an eerie spell and that mel gibson can gasp , shudder and even tremble without losing his machismo . "
neg,don't let the subtitles fool you ; the movie only proves that hollywood no longer has a monopoly on mindless action . 
pos,"functions as both a revealing look at the collaborative process and a timely , tongue-in-cheek profile of the corporate circus that is the recording industry in the current climate of mergers and downsizing . "
pos,"while it's nothing we haven't seen before from murphy , i spy is still fun and enjoyable and so aggressively silly that it's more than a worthwhile effort . "
pos,the magic ( and original running time ) of ace japanimator hayao miyazaki's spirited away survives intact in bv's re-voiced version . 
pos,an exquisitely crafted and acted tale . 
neg,lacks dramatic punch and depth . 
pos,"fontaine masterfully creates a portrait of two strong men in conflict , inextricably entwined through family history , each seeing himself in the other , neither liking what he sees . "
pos,"imperfect ? yes , but also intriguing and honorable , a worthwhile addition to a distinguished film legacy . "

pos,"i am not generally a huge fan of cartoons derived from tv shows , but hey arnold ! the movie is clever , offbeat and even gritty enough to overcome my resistance . "
pos,it grabs you in the dark and shakes you vigorously for its duration . 
pos,transforms one of [shakespeare's] deepest tragedies into a smart new comedy . 
neg,seagal is painfully foolish in trying to hold onto what's left of his passe' chopsocky glory . 
pos,"it pulls the rug out from under you , just when you're ready to hate one character , or really sympathize with another character , something happens to send you off in different direction . "
neg,gets bogged down by an overly sillified plot and stop-and-start pacing . 
pos,"[shyamalan] turns the goose-pimple genre on its empty head and fills it with spirit , purpose and emotionally bruised characters who add up to more than body count . "
neg,"a long , dull procession of despair , set to cello music culled from a minimalist funeral . "

neg,i was perplexed to watch it unfold with an astonishing lack of passion or uniqueness . 
pos,"[jeff's] gorgeous , fluid compositions , underlined by neil finn and edmund mcwilliams's melancholy music , are charged with metaphor , but rarely easy , obvious or self-indulgent . "
neg,faultlessly professional but finally slight . 
pos,what's most striking about this largely celebratory film . . . is the sense of isolation that permeates these bastions of individuality in an ikea world . 
pos,"the movie has no respect for laws , political correctness or common decency , but it displays something more important : respect for its flawed , crazy people . "
neg,"if this silly little cartoon can inspire a few kids not to grow up to be greedy bastards , more power to it . "
neg,"despite juliet stevenon's attempt to bring cohesion to pamela's emotional roller coaster life , it is not enough to give the film the substance it so desperately needs . "

neg,a fairly by-the-books blend of action and romance with sprinklings of intentional and unintentional comedy . 
pos,"an enjoyable film for the family , amusing and cute for both adults and kids . "
pos,"at its best , which occurs often , michael moore's bowling for columbine rekindles the muckraking , soul-searching spirit of the 'are we a sick society ? ' journalism of the 1960s . "
neg,it offers little beyond the momentary joys of pretty and weightless intellectual entertainment . 
neg,frenetic but not really funny . 
neg,like watching a dress rehearsal the week before the show goes up : everything's in place but something's just a little off-kilter . 
pos,"the pleasures of super troopers may be fleeting , but they'll register strongly with anybody who still retains a soft spot for precollegiate humor . "
neg,no such thing breaks no new ground and treads old turf like a hippopotamus ballerina . 
pos,the ya-ya's have many secrets and one is - the books are better . translating complex characters from novels to the big screen is an impossible task but they are true to the essence of what it is to be ya-ya . 
pos,it is great summer fun to watch arnold and his buddy gerald bounce off a quirky cast of characters . 
neg,"a fast-paced , glitzy but extremely silly piece . "
pos,almodovar is an imaginative teacher of emotional intelligence in this engaging film about two men who discover what william james once called 'the gift of tears . '
neg,"none of this is very original , and it isn't particularly funny . "

pos,"the movie's eventual success should be credited to dennis quaid , in fighting trim shape as an athlete as well as an actor"
pos,"[clooney's] debut can be accused of being a bit undisciplined , but it has a tremendous , offbeat sense of style and humor that suggests he was influenced by some of the filmmakers who have directed him , especially the coen brothers and steven soderbergh . "
pos,"by applying definition to both sides of the man , the picture realizes a fullness that does not negate the subject . "
neg,"enough trivializes an important crisis , reduces it to an almost comic embarrassment . "

pos,"unexpected moments of authentically impulsive humor are the hallmark of this bittersweet , uncommonly sincere movie that portrays the frank humanity of…emotional recovery . "
pos,kids should have a stirring time at this beautifully drawn movie . and adults will at least have a dream image of the west to savor whenever the film's lamer instincts are in the saddle . 
pos,"as improbable as this premise may seem , abbass's understated , shining performance offers us the sense that on some elemental level , lilia deeply wants to break free of her old life . "
neg,"it wraps up a classic mother/daughter struggle in recycled paper with a shiny new bow and while the audience can tell it's not all new , at least it looks pretty . "
neg,"though catch me if you can isn't badly made , the fun slowly leaks out of the movie . "
pos,"its cast full of caffeinated comedy performances more than make up for its logical loopholes , which fly by so fast there's no time to think about them anyway . "
pos,the movie sticks much closer to hornby's drop-dead confessional tone than the film version of high fidelity did .

neg,"one of those based-on-truth stories that persuades you , with every scene , that it could never really have happened this way . "
pos,a mischievous visual style and oodles of charm make 'cherish' a very good ( but not great ) movie . 
neg,"as predictable as the outcome of a globetrotters-generals game , juwanna mann is even more ludicrous than you'd expect from the guy-in-a-dress genre , and a personal low for everyone involved . "
pos,"a compelling , gut-clutching piece of advocacy cinema that carries you along in a torrent of emotion as it explores the awful complications of one terrifying day . "
neg,mr . soderbergh's direction and visual style struck me as unusually and unimpressively fussy and pretentious . 
neg,"the acting is just fine , but there's not enough substance here to sustain interest for the full 90 minutes , especially with the weak payoff . "
pos,not since tom cruise in risky business has an actor made such a strong impression in his underwear . 
neg,this is an insultingly inept and artificial examination of grief and its impacts upon the relationships of the survivors . 
pos,"dark , resonant , inventively detailed and packed with fleet turns of plot and a feast of visual amazement . "
pos,"as part of mr . dong's continuing exploration of homosexuality in america , family fundamentals is an earnest study in despair . "

neg,"so muddled , repetitive and ragged that it says far less about the horrifying historical reality than about the filmmaker's characteristic style . "
pos,"fresh and raw like a blown-out vein , narc takes a walking-dead , cop-flick subgenre and beats new life into it . "
neg,a crisply made movie that is no more than mildly amusing . 
pos,this remake gets all there is to get out of a peculiar premise with promise : al pacino loathing robin williams . 
pos,plummer steals the show without resorting to camp as nicholas' wounded and wounding uncle ralph . it's a great performance and a reminder of dickens' grandeur . 
neg,all too familiar . . . basically the sort of cautionary tale that was old when 'angels with dirty faces' appeared in 1938 . 
neg,"it's a loathsome movie , it really is and it makes absolutely no sense . "
pos,"muccino seems to be exploring the idea of why human beings long for what they don't have , and how this gets us in trouble . but even while his characters are acting horribly , he is always sympathetic . "
neg,the story the movie tells is of brian de palma's addiction to the junk-calorie suspense tropes that have all but ruined his career . 
neg,"a movie more to be prescribed than recommended -- as visually bland as a dentist's waiting room , complete with soothing muzak and a cushion of predictable narrative rhythms . "
neg,"being unique doesn't necessarily equate to being good , no matter how admirably the filmmakers have gone for broke . "
