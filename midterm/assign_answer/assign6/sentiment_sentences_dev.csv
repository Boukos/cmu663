neg,"wouldn't it be funny if a bunch of allied soldiers went undercover as women in a german factory during world war ii ? um , no . but here's a movie about it anyway . "
pos,a tour de force of modern cinema . 
neg,"it is a comedy that's not very funny and an action movie that is not very thrilling ( and an uneasy alliance , at that ) . "
pos,"though the film is static , its writer-director's heart is in the right place , his plea for democracy and civic action laudable . "

pos,"in the affable maid in manhattan , jennifer lopez's most aggressive and most sincere attempt to take movies by storm , the diva shrewdly surrounds herself with a company of strictly a-list players . "
pos,monte cristo smartly emphasizes the well-wrought story and omits needless chase scenes and swordfights as the revenge unfolds . 
pos,one of the smartest takes on singles culture i've seen in a long time . 
neg,"high crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government/ marine/legal mystery , and that's because the movie serves up all of that stuff , nearly subliminally , as the old-hat province of male intrigue . "
pos,"a witty , trenchant , wildly unsentimental but flawed look at the ins and outs of modern moviemaking . "
neg,demeo is not without talent ; he just needs better material . 
neg,"mckay seems embarrassed by his own invention and tries to rush through the intermediary passages , apparently hoping that the audience will not notice the glaring triteness of the plot device he has put in service . "

neg,the jokes are telegraphed so far in advance they must have been lost in the mail .

neg,"the beautiful images and solemn words cannot disguise the slack complacency of [godard's] vision , any more than the gorgeous piano and strings on the soundtrack can drown out the tinny self-righteousness of his voice . "
neg,"mr . goyer's loose , unaccountable direction is technically sophisticated in the worst way . "
neg,"starts out with tremendous promise , introducing an intriguing and alluring premise , only to fall prey to a boatload of screenwriting cliches that sink it faster than a leaky freighter . "
neg,"the beautiful , unusual music is this film's chief draw , but its dreaminess may lull you to sleep . "
pos,"a pleasant enough movie , held together by skilled ensemble actors . "
neg,tsai may be ploughing the same furrow once too often . 
neg,"it's just too bad the screenwriters eventually shoot themselves in the feet with cop flick cliches like an oily arms dealer , squad car pile-ups and the requisite screaming captain . "
pos,lacks the inspiration of the original and has a bloated plot that stretches the running time about 10 minutes past a child's interest and an adult's patience . but it also has many of the things that made the first one charming . 
pos,"if [jaglom's] latest effort is not the director at his most sparkling , some of its repartee is still worth hearing . "
pos,"the film's greatest asset is how much it's not just another connect-the-dots , spy-on-the-run picture . "

neg,"although it tries to be much more , it's really just another major league . "
pos,for most of the distance the picture provides a satisfyingly unsettling ride into the dark places of our national psyche . 
pos,"<em>ash wednesday</em> is not edward burns' best film , but it is a good and ambitious film . and it marks him as one of the most interesting writer/directors working today . "
pos,"keenly observed and refreshingly natural , swimming gets the details right , from its promenade of barely clad bodies in myrtle beach , s . c . , to the adrenaline jolt of a sudden lunch rush at the diner . "
neg,"while the transgressive trappings ( especially the frank sex scenes ) ensure that the film is never dull , rodrigues's beast-within metaphor is ultimately rather silly and overwrought , making the ambiguous ending seem goofy rather than provocative . "
neg,it's lazy for a movie to avoid solving one problem by trying to distract us with the solution to another . 
pos,"it may not be as cutting , as witty or as true as back in the glory days of weekend and two or three things i know about her , but who else engaged in filmmaking today is so cognizant of the cultural and moral issues involved in the process ? "
pos,"sparkling , often hilarious romantic jealousy comedy . . . attal looks so much like a young robert deniro that it seems the film should instead be called 'my husband is travis bickle' . "

pos,this is the best american movie about troubled teens since 1998's whatever . 
pos,"greene delivers a typically solid performance in a role that is a bit of a departure from the noble characters he has played in the past , and he is matched by schweig , who carries the film on his broad , handsome shoulders . "

pos,it's the kind of pigeonhole-resisting romp that hollywood too rarely provides . 
pos,i admired this work a lot . 
neg,"it's a film that hinges on its casting , and glover really doesn't fit the part . "
neg,"sit through this one , and you won't need a magic watch to stop time ; your dvd player will do it for you . "
neg,the film's needlessly opaque intro takes its doe-eyed crudup out of pre-9/11 new york and onto a cross-country road trip of the homeric kind . 
pos,"in its dry and forceful way , it delivers the same message as jiri menzel's closely watched trains and danis tanovic's no man's land . "
neg,"bad in such a bizarre way that it's almost worth seeing , if only to witness the crazy confluence of purpose and taste . "
pos,"like the best 60 minutes exposé , the film ( at 80 minutes ) is actually quite entertaining . "
neg,overburdened with complicated plotting and banal dialogue
pos,"thought-provoking and stylish , if also somewhat hermetic . "
neg,"anyone who wants to start writing screenplays can just follow the same blueprint from hundreds of other films , sell it to the highest bidder and walk away without anyone truly knowing your identity . "

pos,"it's mildly entertaining , especially if you find comfort in familiarity . but it's hardly a necessary enterprise . "
neg,"although barbershop boasts some of today's hottest and hippest acts from the world of television , music and stand-up comedy , this movie strangely enough has the outdated swagger of a shameless ‘70s blaxploitation shuck-and-jive sitcom . "
neg,"lots of effort and intelligence are on display but in execution it is all awkward , static , and lifeless rumblings . "
neg,the entire movie is in need of a scented bath . 
pos,director nancy savoca's no-frills record of a show forged in still-raw emotions captures the unsettled tenor of that post 9-11 period far better than a more measured or polished production ever could . 
neg,some stunning visuals -- and some staggeringly boring cinema . 
neg,most of the action setups are incoherent . 
pos,"as a tolerable diversion , the film suffices ; a triumph , however , it is not . "
pos,this surreal gilliam-esque film is also a troubling interpretation of ecclesiastes . a rewarding work of art for only the most patient and challenge-hungry moviegoers . 
pos,"the actors are simply too good , and the story too intriguing , for technical flaws to get in the way . "

pos,"spinning a web of dazzling entertainment may be overstating it , but  spider-man  certainly delivers the goods . "
pos,"unlike lots of hollywood fluff , this has layered , well-developed characters and some surprises . "
neg,"the gags , and the script , are a mixed bag . "
neg,"it is depressing , ruthlessly pained and depraved , the movie equivalent of staring into an open wound . "
neg,a family-friendly fantasy that ends up doing very little with its imaginative premise . 
neg,fear dot com is more frustrating than a modem that disconnects every 10 seconds . 
neg,"woody , what happened ? "
pos,charlotte sometimes is a gem . it's always enthralling . 
pos,the film does give a pretty good overall picture of the situation in laramie following the murder of matthew shepard . 
neg,"with a tone as variable as the cinematography , schaeffer's film never settles into the light-footed enchantment the material needs , and the characters' quirks and foibles never jell into charm . "
neg,an ugly-duckling tale so hideously and clumsily told it feels accidental . 
neg,the sequel plays out like a flimsy excuse to give blade fans another look at wesley snipes' iconic hero doing battle with dozens of bad guys -- at once . 
neg,"quite frankly , i can't see why any actor of talent would ever work in a mcculloch production again if they looked at how this movie turned out . "
neg,"feels at times like a giant commercial for universal studios , where much of the action takes place . "

pos,"like a veteran head cutter , barbershop is tuned in to its community . "
pos,a gem of a movie . 
pos,"there are problems with this film that even 3 oscar winners can't overcome , but it's a nice girl-buddy movie once it gets rock-n-rolling . "
neg,exploring value choices is a worthwhile topic for a film -- but here the choices are as contrived and artificial as kerrigan's platinum-blonde hair . 
neg,"without a fresh infusion of creativity , 4ever is neither a promise nor a threat so much as wishful thinking . "
pos,"a sweet , tender sermon about a 12-year-old welsh boy more curious about god than girls , who learns that believing in something does matter . "
pos,"for a long time the film succeeds with its dark , delicate treatment of these characters and its unerring respect for them . "
pos,"k-19 will not go down in the annals of cinema as one of the great submarine stories , but it is an engaging and exciting narrative of man confronting the demons of his own fear and paranoia . "
pos,"an exceedingly clever piece of cinema . another great ‘what you don't see' is much more terrifying than what you do see thriller , coupled with some arresting effects , incandescent tones and stupendous performances"
pos,"a gem of a romantic crime comedy that turns out to be clever , amusing and unpredictable . "
pos,the wild thornberrys movie is a jolly surprise .

neg,the only thing that distinguishes a randall wallace film from any other is the fact that there is nothing distinguishing in a randall wallace film . 
pos,"the tone errs on the shrill side , tempered by a soft southern gentility that speaks of beauty , grace and a closet full of skeletons . "
neg,"the film affords us intriguing glimpses of the insights gleaned from a lifetime of spiritual inquiry , but ram dass : fierce grace doesn't organize it with any particular insight . "
neg,mib ii is a movie that makes it possible for the viewer to doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand and/or restroom and not feel as if he or she has missed anything . that's because relatively nothing happens .

pos,a solidly entertaining little film .

neg,sometimes smart but more often sophomoric . 
neg,"on a certain base level , blue crush delivers what it promises , just not well enough to recommend it . "
neg,"while the film is competent , it's also uninspired , lacking the real talent and wit to elevate it beyond its formula to the level of classic romantic comedy to which it aspires . "
neg,"elicits more groans from the audience than jar jar binks , scrappy doo and scooby dumb , all wrapped up into one . "
neg,"a boring , pretentious muddle that uses a sensational , real-life 19th-century crime as a metaphor for -- well , i'm not exactly sure what -- and has all the dramatic weight of a raindrop . "
pos,the filmmakers skillfully evoke the sense of menace that nature holds for many urban dwellers .

pos,steers turns in a snappy screenplay that curls at the edges ; it's so clever you want to hate it . but he somehow pulls it off . 
pos,"leaping from one arresting image to another , songs from the second floor has all the enjoyable randomness of a very lively dream and so manages to be compelling , amusing and unsettling at the same time . "

neg,"wendigo wants to be a monster movie for the art-house crowd , but it falls into the trap of pretention almost every time . "
neg,chan's stunts are limited and so embellished by editing that there's really not much of a sense of action or even action-comedy .

neg,"shallow , noisy and pretentious . "
pos,"lookin' for sin , american-style ? try hell house , which documents the cautionary christian spook-a-rama of the same name . "
pos,"it's a piece of handiwork that shows its indie tatters and self-conscious seams in places , but has some quietly moving moments and an intelligent subtlety . "
pos,"it's a visual delight and a decent popcorn adventure , as long as you don't try to look too deep into the story"
neg,even legends like alfred hitchcock and john huston occasionally directed trifles . . . so it's no surprise to see a world-class filmmaker like zhang yimou behind the camera for a yarn that's ultimately rather inconsequential .

pos,"both heartbreaking and heartwarming . . . just a simple fable done in an artless sytle , but it's tremendously moving . "
pos,noyce films it more as a shocking history lesson than as drama . 
neg,"as dumb and cheesy as they may be , the cartoons look almost shakespearean -- both in depth and breadth -- after watching this digital-effects-heavy , supposed family-friendly comedy . "

neg,"adults , other than the parents . . . will be hard pressed to succumb to the call of the wild . "
pos,"if you ever wondered what it would be like to be smack in the middle of a war zone armed with nothing but a camera , this oscar-nominated documentary takes you there . "
pos,"although it includes a fair share of dumb drug jokes and predictable slapstick ,  orange county  is far funnier than it would seem to have any right to be . "

neg,"cassavetes thinks he's making dog day afternoon with a cause , but all he's done is to reduce everything he touches to a shrill , didactic cartoon . "
pos,despite its many infuriating flaws -- not the least of which is amy's self-absorbed personality -- amy's o's honesty will win you over . 
neg,"a slight and obvious effort , even for one whose target demographic is likely still in the single digits , age-wise . "
neg,the director has injected self-consciousness into the proceedings at every turn . the results are far more alienating than involving . 
pos,"a highly personal look at the effects of living a dysfunctionally privileged lifestyle , and by the end , we only wish we could have spent more time in its world . "
pos,"it's an example of sophisticated , challenging filmmaking that stands , despite its noticeable lack of emotional heft , in welcome contrast to the indulgent dead-end experimentation of the director's previous full frontal . "
pos,"director benoit jacquot , making his first opera-to-film translation with tosca , conveys the heaving passion of puccini's famous love-jealousy- murder-suicide fandango with great cinematic innovation . "
neg,"stuffy , full of itself , morally ambiguous and nothing to shout about . "

neg,a sophomoric exploration of 'life problems' most people solved long ago -- or at least got tired of hearing people kvetch about .

neg,might best be enjoyed as a daytime soaper . 
neg,"the angst-ridden , affluent slacker characters are more grating than engaging . "
neg,contrived pastiche of caper clichés . 
pos,the level of acting elevates the material above pat inspirational status and gives it a sturdiness and solidity that we've long associated with washington the actor . 
neg,"as with too many studio pics , plot mechanics get in the way of what should be the lighter-than-air adventure . "
neg,the film's few ideas are stretched to the point of evaporation ; the whole central section is one big chase that seems to have no goal and no urgency . it's just filler . 
neg,"if you collected all the moments of coherent dialogue , they still wouldn't add up to the time required to boil a four- minute egg . "
pos,"while the stoically delivered hokum of hart's war is never fun , it's still a worthy addition to the growing canon of post-saving private ryan tributes to the greatest generation . "
pos,"at once subtle and visceral , the film never succumbs to the trap of the maudlin or tearful , offering instead with its unflinching gaze a measure of faith in the future . "
pos,with exquisite craftsmanship . . . olivier assayas has fashioned an absorbing look at provincial bourgeois french society .

neg,"even with its $50-million us budget , pinocchio never quite achieves the feel of a fanciful motion picture . "
neg,the movie doesn't add anything fresh to the myth .

neg,"no worse than a lot of the crap we've been offered this summer , and slightly better than men in black 2 as far as slapdash extraterrestrial comedies go . "

neg,the most surprising thing about this film is that they are actually releasing it into theaters . 
neg,"it is parochial , accessible to a chosen few , standoffish to everyone else , and smugly suggests a superior moral tone is more important than filmmaking skill"
pos,i loved the look of this film . 
neg,one of the most incoherent features in recent memory . 
pos,a strangely stirring experience that finds warmth in the coldest environment and makes each crumb of emotional comfort feel like a 10-course banquet . 
neg,"blue crush follows the formula , but throws in too many conflicts to keep the story compelling . "
neg,"at times , the suspense is palpable , but by the end there's a sense that the crux of the mystery hinges on a technicality that strains credulity and leaves the viewer haunted by the waste of potential . "
neg,"when your subject is illusion versus reality , shouldn't the reality seem at least passably real ? "
neg,[t]he film is never sure to make a clear point – even if it seeks to rely on an ambiguous presentation . 
pos,mark pellington's latest pop thriller is as kooky and overeager as it is spooky and subtly in love with myth . 
pos,"like its title character , this nicholas nickleby finds itself in reduced circumstances -- and , also like its hero , it remains brightly optimistic , coming through in the end . "

pos,  auto focus  works as an unusual biopic and document of male swingers in the playboy era
pos,the wild thornberrys movie is pleasant enough and the message of our close ties with animals can certainly not be emphasized enough . 
neg,jaglom offers the none-too-original premise that everyone involved with moviemaking is a con artist and a liar . 
pos,the film is one of the year's best . 
pos,"nair and writer laura cahill dare to build a movie around some flawed but rather unexceptional women , emerging with a fine character study that's short on plot but rich in the tiny revelations of real life . "

neg,"steve oedekerk is , alas , no woody allen . "
pos,lawrence plumbs personal tragedy and also the human comedy .

pos,"an energizing , intoxicating documentary charting the rise of hip-hop culture in general and the art of scratching ( or turntablism ) in particular . "
neg,always destined to be measured against anthony asquith's acclaimed 1952 screen adaptation . 
pos,"dense , exhilarating documentary . "

pos,"the tone is balanced , reflective and reasonable . "
neg,"like life on the island , the movie grows boring despite the scenery . "
neg,"although purportedly a study in modern alienation , it's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out . "
neg," . . . while the humor aspects of 'jason x' were far more entertaining than i had expected , everything else about the film tanks . "
pos,"that rare movie that works on any number of levels -- as a film of magic and whimsy for children , a heartfelt romance for teenagers and a compelling argument about death , both pro and con , for adults . "
neg,i didn't believe for a moment in these villains or their plot . 
pos,"the film's constant mood of melancholy and its unhurried narrative are masterfully controlled . but … in trying to capture the novel's deeper intimate resonances , the film has – ironically - distanced us from the characters . "
pos,"while bollywood/hollywood will undoubtedly provide its keenest pleasures to those familiar with bombay musicals , it also has plenty for those ( like me ) who aren't . "
