As is what /everyone/ else perceives.Which always makes me think of the Street of the Gods from Simon Green's Nightside books, or Tai-tastigon from P.C. Hodgell's Godstalk - where believe literally shapes reality.At any rate, I look forward to a great deal of reading, both professionally and from my classmates, and hope we all have a blast.Carrie;Have you seen the work expectations page? It's good to read the whole lot I think and then concentrate on a particular theme or aspect.http://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/fantasysf/Documents/WorkExpectations.htmlAbout the essays it says'Your essays should aim to enrich the reading of a fellow student who is both intelligent and attentive to the readings and to the course. Each essay should be between 270 and 320 words. Attentive readers notice more than casual readers do, although casual readers may be responding unconsciously to many of the matters that attentive readers notice consciously. This difference in reading awareness arises in part from the fact that attention is limited. If I am attentive to the use of triples in fairy tales (three brothers on a quest, three questions testing the hero, and so on), then I might find that I   m not consciously attentive to other aspects of the narrative (the comparative intrinsic worth or worthlessness of the object of the quest, the rhetorical construction of a testing question, and so on). Because attention is limited, to understand works more deeply we need to slow down and take note of aspects of the reading that we find significant. Then, using those notes and reviewing the work, we can come to a hypothesis about what that significance might be. For example, if one notices that fairy godmothers occur only for child protagonists whose biological mother is dead, one might hypothesize that, at least psychologically, the fairy godmother takes the role of a mother and the fairy godmother   s entrance in a story is a promise of the love and protection that the protagonist has had taken away. The fairy godmother, then, is not so much a figure of magic as her magic is a metaphor for the continuing power of motherhood.Writing these essays and reading and commenting on the essays of your fellow students should make you much better prepared to learn from, and even question, the unit clips. Therefore, these essays should be submitted before viewing any of the unit clips other than the introduction'.;I f you click on Peer responses and then follow through to the Grimm brothers assignment there is a description of the assignment   that gives an example using the Sleeping Beauty story.

It will be great to see you all in both classes and hear what you have to say about the material.  ;Hello everyone....m too doing the Fiction of relationship course :)nice to see so many people around the world ""like me"" Hope to see you all there as well.cheers!;Welcome to the class, Jim! I spent about six years in Chicago, 3 of those were spent in school, got MFA in Creative Writing there. I miss it so much but, like most, it got too cold for me.

I was just looking over the Open U's course offerings the other day. Lots of great stuff but I had already signed up here and didn't want to overload myself. I'm in the Fiction of Relationships too! There's another person, Nina, who posted here, who is also in that course. I'm a bit nervous that I don't get my ideas between the readings for the different classes confused with each other. Organizing is not my strongest point. ""Busy...""   You got that right!  ;Thanks for sharing that Michelle. I'll keep it in mind.  ;Nice to meet you Endrell! I got my MFA in Creative Writing at SAIC and was in Chicago for about 6 years. I miss the place so much (except for the winters). It will be interesting to hear your perspective on the readings with your background and experience.   ;The one problem I have always had is coming up with a thesis. Either my mind has too many ideas about what might be going on in a story, or I have a problem with carrying a thought out to its logical conclusion. Likely the latter.  Hopefully this course will force me to hone that skill!;The priority here, it seems to me, is to read slowly and focus on developing close reading skills. Once we feel confident about that, any other resources or links would enrich our understanding of the   broader context around the work.;I'm not going to use any supplemental texts unless/until we get a firm answer on this, but in the past, I dealt with the issue by writing my essay first, and then scanning supplemental materials to see if I'd *missed* something (or worse, completely misinterpreted something!). Having said that, one of my English teachers in high school ""caught"" me checking out Cliffs Notes for The House of Seven Gables at the local public library and was aghast that one of her best students would resort to such a thing! Fortunately, I was in another teacher's class at that time, and trying to get to grips with *summer* reading... and I was nearly in tears trying to figure out what on earth he was on about. So she very kindly took an hour out of her day to explain the finer points of Hawthorne to me. I still hate Hawthorne with a passion, but I also still adore that teacher. I was lucky enough to have her again for AP English the following year, and she ended every class by making sure she had done her job well enough, and got us thinking about the material on our own enough, that none of us had to do something so horribly *gauche*   and *unimaginative* as resort to Cliffs Notes/Spark Notes. :);That is so awesome!

It would be great to meet for discussion once in a while.  ;My favorite book is Diary by Chuck Palahniuk. My favorite authors are Chuck Palahniuk, Augusten Burroughs, Kurt Vonnugut, Ernest Hemingway, George Orwell, and J.R.R. Tolkien. Although that list could become endless if I did not limit myself.  ;I think as far as fantasy and science fiction, my favorite is Ursula LeGuin. And my favorite books of hers are the earthsea trilogy. I don't read a lot of fantasy or science fiction these days. I am enjoying everyone's recommendations.;Let's see. My favorite author of all time is Virginia Woolf.I like quite a few Guatemalan authors (if you speak Spanish, I can upload some readings for you). Virginia Woolf is my favorite author of all time, yet some of my favorite (literature) books are:The Perks of Being a WallflowerThe Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar WaoInterpreter of MaladiesThe God of Small ThingsFebruary FlowersBlind Willow, Sleeping WomanThe Woman DestroyedIf on a Winter's Night a Traveller1984Brave New WorldAlice's Adventures in Wonderland... and well, many more, but those are my favorites.I confess myself a Harry Potter and Hunger Games, too.I'm also a HUGE fan on Jared Diamond's works. Anyone?;Ooohh, Diana Wynne Jones - so much fun to read. Tolkien and Hobb are other old friends - and of course, King. I am so going to have to go over this list once I get home and can hit up the library. Muhahahaha. *ahem*;I love Tolkien and Hobb!! Can't wait to start more of Hobb's books soon!;I love reading, especially fantasy books. There are books I have read many times, but when I fall in love with a book, I fall quickly and hard. When it comes to fantasy and science fiction, I adore The Harry Potter series, the Lord of the Rings trilogy and lately I fell in love with Anne Bishop's The Black Jewels Trilogy.  ;I read an overabundant amount of poetry. In fact, I never feel like I read too many books which I'd like to change. My favorite are Oscar Wilde, Walt Whitman, Maya Angelou, Robert Browning, Emily Dickinson, Thomas Gray, Sylvia Plath, Shakespeare, Gwendolyn Bennett. I'm really hoping to expand and start reading more books. ;Fav authors: Isaac Asimov and Terry Pratchet. Favorite genres: horror, sci-fi/fantasy, ghost stories, and the classics. Many of the books that we are suppose to read, I've already read at one point. I remember reading Dracula in jr high. And that was a while ago. It was an abridged version of it. I've read Lewis Carroll's works, Grimms Fairy Tales, and reread Frankenstein in the past 3 years. When I read, I read for pleasure, not exactly fond of taking apart stories for ""deeper meanings"", but will do my best. ;here is my profile!

Thank you for your generosity! Hopefully we'll all find opportunities repay it as the course continues :) Enjoy yourself and cheers!;I read in English. My native language is Spanish. I think my understanding is pretty good, but I am more worried about the writing part.;You have time to get those books in English if you want and read them. If you're unsure about the translation, maybe it's a good option for you.  ;My native language is Icelandic but I prefer reading non-Icelandic books in English so I'll be reading all the books in this course in English.;Thank you so much for offering this course. I am very excited to get started. As I already read quite slowly, I was wondering if you could let us know what specific tales by the Brother's Grimm we will be discussing. I was not able to get the version suggested in the notes but I own a volume of Grimm's Complete Fairy Tales. I am not sure which tales overlap. I have been reading them in the evenings with my children but I would like to be sure to pay special attention to those that we will be discussing.;Thank you! That is a beautiful edition of these tales.;Thanks a lot! Librivox is almost always very good, though occasionally the old adage of ""You get what you pay for"" rings painfully true. ;I had the same problem and couldn't finish the course last time. My daughter unenrolled me by mistake and I was unable to enroll again.I plan to re-submit my essays, except for a couple I wasn't very happy with. Fortunately, I guess, I didn't see the lectures for most of the course so can't be influenced by them.I don't think you can have self-plagiarism, can you?;I am seriuoslt bummed that I need to bail out of this course. I believe that it is the perfect amalgamation between two of my great loves; writing and the inner working of the human mind but unfortunately I have dished too much into my plate at this time and as this is the most recent addition it is also the one that must take it's place on the back burner. Anything worth doing is worth doing right so I can't risk neglecting this course as a result of my other obligations or vice versa. I wish you all luck in the course and have added it to my watchlist so that i can be sure to hop on next time it comes around. But may I attempt at opening up a discussion before I leave? For interests sake. Why did you enroll in this course and what do you hope to learn from it? I was personally hoping to see if I could determine how external influences ( economic, geographic etc) could influence a writer. As well as the relationship between both science fiction and science fact and our need for fantasies as a society. I'm certain that you may believe that I am over reaching in my expectations of this course but I am certain that at least some of this may come to light, if not from the material then from the community involvement through Peer Responses and Forum posts.;try getting the files (books) in epub, mobi or azw, most of them are avaible in the links this site recomends, then you just open them on your kindle for pc with no problem, also you may try the calibre software to convert some of the files to formats the kindle and other e reading software use.mozilla Firefox has an e-reader that may come in handy in the future if the problem persists.  Calibre linkhttp://calibre-ebook.com/download_windowsSome of the books may be found here in e book formathttp://www.gutenberg.org/;I found this to be an interesting tale, too. I especially liked how the little lies she told just fell perfectly into place, as if she had been planning such a prank for years.;The Grimm tales haven't been part of my upbringing. I have read them as a part of the college curricula. I have been reading them again and I have enjoyed reading of 'Six Soldiers of Fortune'. It is very rhythmic story, I felt.  ;I had to go back and reread that section.   Notice how very delicately they mention that they were married for a while, and the prince came to her at a time of day when the witch wouldn't be there... ;);My version is a little different? He asked her to marry him but she said ""I would willingly go with thee, but I do not know how I shall get out. When thou comest, bring each time a silken rope, and I will make a ladder, and when it is quite ready I will get down by it out of the tower, and thou shalt take me away on thy horse."" Naughty naughty!;But consider the question she asks the witch that gives her away:""Mother Gothel, how is it that you climb up here so slowly, and the King's son is with me in a moment?""Clearly, though she can't climb down, he is not having any trouble climbing up!;I agree with both of you, however, I would like to point out a few things. Sci-fi was in it's own right a fantasy, an imagining of the possibilities of technology. But as we progressed closer to the reality of these fantasies, I feel that authors, screenwriters and even artists became too concerned with making their imagined 'technologies' more credible so that it could stand up to the scrutiny of their fanbase. So the artform became science in a fiction setting instead of fictional science. Which is why I feel that the resurgence of steampunk has become so prevalent. Sci-fi could do with a little more fantasy once again.;It interests me that SFF like Mieville's seems to go back to the early fantastic/weird tales of Jules Verne and co., and that Steampunk's really flowering.  ;Yes, glad to know. I hop e to be able to do this course. It's th e end of tehe schoolyear and I have to read final papers and tests from my students.Fortunatilly I've read mostra of th e books.Ser you in class;Yeah, I also saw it. My guess is they are left from the previous course.  ;Lol ... pleased others saw this.   I almost unenrolled thinking that I made the error!   Oh well, no doubt they'll get fixed up as soon as Prof sees this thread!;It seems to me the Professor is referring to the human ability of thinking up something they would like (or fear) to meet in the real life instead of fantasy as a genre of fiction. As an ability of mind, fantasy is necessary to produce any work of fiction, fantasy and science fiction just being the genres where this is the most evident. This is the way I understood the statement.;Thank you very much for explaining this to me.I understand how large the class is and of course the professor and staff are not going to grade everyone's essays (sorry, Emily, doesn't happen that way).In the Greek and Roman Mythology course, we also have to do at least five peer reviews (many of us decided to do more). These assessments were only counted as that we did them. The grades given by peers are not in any way reflected in the final grade. An assignment is considered completed when an essay is written, submitted, and the writer responds to at least five peer essays.To me, that is a much better solution. It is not a matter of getting lucky with peer reviewers, it is an ethical wrongdoing that goes against everything I have learned through my education courses and as a teacher myself.  ;Katrina, I feel like you may be feeling like you have your back up against a wall, especially as a result of some unhelpful anonymous comments. I'm not upset at all by your comments. I was struck by your strong objections to it as a grading schema. My comments are not meant as an attack in any form, more of a ""she's  making interesting points, I want to know more.""   My comments were intended as offering another way of thinking about the grading scheme. I'm a social scientist at heart so I'm thoroughly interested in effects of and reactions to educational processes. Peer review and its relationship to fostering skills and community are topics of great interest to me professionally. Can you talk more about what your ethical objections to peer review are? Is there a system you think would work more effectively (please see my comments about fear of robots with a grading schema like the Mythology course)? ;I was wondering about the whole peer review process at first, first of all afraid there would be too few people signed up for the course, second of all that the others would be.....um.....not likely to be helpful? is that the best way to put it?.....but look at the introductions, we have a LOT of people that we should be HONORED to get their opinions on our work, and I think we will get a lot of value out of this course.   I was wondering, though--if there are any outstanding essays, will they be shared with the rest of us?   ;Yes, they do. Amazing to think of how many are taking this course, over 30,000 on my previous course! Really looking forward to learning with the Professor.;In my experience from previous Coursera-courses, peer assessment as part of the final grade works fine. :) I am under the impression that people do evaluate others in the same way they hope that others evaluate them - fairly and thoughtfully. So I wouldn't worry too much about this right now. If you do feel however that you're repeatedly getting very unfair feedback, then you should of course bring it up again later. For now I'd say that there is no reason to worry.;Thank you, Anonymous, for that example.  ;Thank you all for your input. I really did not mean to spark a heated debate, and for that, I am sorry. Frankly, I am surprised at how many people are okay with this system and at some of the comments I received just from asking a question. I always thought I was a progressive educator, but there are some things in which I will not budge. At this point, we must agree to disagree.  I am glad I made someone laugh at least, if nothing else. Happy  reading all!;Hey guys. I hope i'm doing the right thing in exposing my thesis here.I'm hoping for some input, because I don't want to be overly confident about this and then find out there were a bunch of loop holes.  Reading the book I started to notice a difference in the roles played by luck and virtues in the stories where the hero is a man depending on the male's social status.   In other words, whenever the hero is a common man, be it a tailor or a soldier, he's role as a hero is only established through trials and the use of some skill or virtue. On the other hand, princes or ""king's sons"", as it is usually put, barely need any virtues for luck is always on their side. Take the princes in Rapunzel and Briar Rose, for exemple. The first one happens upon   the tower where the beautiful girl is trapped and is lucky enough to catch the enchantress calling the girl and climbing the tower. Not only that, after falling from the tower and having his eyes pierced, has the luck of bumping into his beloved now in the desert and having his ailments permanently cured. The second one is just lucky enough to find the castle just as the hundred year curse had expired and the thorns posed no danger anymore.The only example I found that might contradict this theory is ""The Frog-prince"", in which the prince had to use his cunning to have the princess keep her promise and break his spell. Although this is true, one can argue that this character is not really a prince, as his title was stripped from him, along with his luck, when he was turned into a creature that was less than human.So far, this is what I have. Can I get some comments from you guys? Am I on the right track?;I guess Gulliver's Travels is proof that not all utopian fiction is science fiction. It is interesting that we look back on these fantasy fictions and label them sci-fi because they are utopian or dystopian. I ask Where is the middle ground? is fantasy always so polarised?;I definitely think that dystopian fiction is science fiction. These are some of my favorite stories to read, and I have read tons of them :-) It makes me sad that most of the newer ones seem to be for teens or young adults, but I read them anyway and enjoy the amazing new worlds being created. My favorite is the Divergent series by Veronica Roth, and if you haven't read them, I would suggest you do!;  What are the pleasures of fairy tales? Where are the neuronal paths that create the attraction to these old tales? How is it that in this super fast changing world, still these tales make me pour myself a cup of tea and draw into a corner and sink in pleasure. The tales that defy every single thing I've ever been taught about causal chain, plotting, character building, narrative viewpoint. Everything. And old as they are, how is it that I cannot put the book down?  And as writers, how do we create an effect like this?;I totally agree, Anon. They do picture for us, what fear can do, what being brave can bring, and one of my favorites, Hans in Luck, the uplifting optimism. They paint the face of humanity, bare. Desires, fears, all bare, no makeup, no justification.  I marvel at them, despite the horror they sometimes depict.  Yet, I am at a loss in how to create an effect like that.   Thanks;To the Berkeley fellow I say: Oh, baloney.   The Grimms' stories have incredibly obvious biblical themes woven all through them.   And if he thinks Western Christians had to be duped by Disney into liking their own fairy tales, he needs to read Lewis and Tolkien a whole lot more closely.;What did everyone think of Pan's Labyrinth (or those who saw it)? I had a mixed reaction to it. And, while we are on the subject, I know so many fantasy fans that love Labyrinth, but that movie bugs me to no end. I just didn't think it was very well written and the acting wasn't all that great either. I thought Legend was much better done for that time.;I love Pan's Labyrinth.

Some of us try to fill it as fast as possible with every observation we've ever had about the text (me) and some of us throw down bullet points and then struggle to figure out how we can elaborate on what we just said. I know the pain of the latter problem, because I used to be that way, too.I don't know if this will be helpful for you or not, but I'm going to try something I've never done before vis-a-vis essay writing, inspired by Dr. Rabkin's examples - I'm going to take down my bulletpoints *as* I read, and then when I'm finished with the book, I'll have a list to cull and expand on. That way, I won't get stuck by being too literal (as often happened to me when I was struggling to fill the page), but I also won't be tempted to throw every possible theme and plot point at the wall in an orgy of self-satisfied personal discovery.At least, that's the theory. I'm not sure how well it will work, because I've never taken notes *as* I read before. I know that's probably heresy to many in this class, but the physical act of writing is difficult for me due to congenital disability, and my mother raised me to believe that the greatest crime in the world was to ""deface"" a book - so the combination of the two meant stopping to take notes threw me out of the story (and I love story!). This time around though, technology has made taking notes significantly less physically difficult, so I have a better chance of remembering to tap things out along the way.And in case anyone needs it, here's one of my favorite quotations from Aaron Sorkin, one of the greatest writers in film and television still alive today:     I love writing, but hate starting. The page is awfully white and it says, 'You may have fooled some of the people, some of the time, but those days are over, Giftless. I'm not your agent and I'm not your mommy: I'm a white piece of paper. You wanna dance with me?' and I really, really don't. I'll go peaceable-like.

But I still break out in a cold sweat when I think about doing literary essays. I can write the heck out of any other kind - historical, sociological, scientific, whatever, but literary essays - ack. I remember angrily telling my mother that university was an upperclass game this working class kid didn't know how to play, because when I asked my professors what they expected, the answer was ""you're in college now, you need to figure that out yourself."" To which my mental reply was, ""I'm paying $20k a year and you won't even tell me the rules?!"" Like you, age and experience has taught me that the problem was *those particular professors* (who, I don't think it's a stretch to say, looked at what was then a 16 year old kid in a wheelchair who was only able to attend thanks to scholarships, decided I didn't belong there, and did their best to make me feel unwelcome) - not my scholastic ability. I now know that if I ever attend a school where the answer to ""can you please clarify the parameters of this assignment?"" is ""figure it out yourself,"" I am at the *wrong* school for me and need to get out of there! At 16, I just didn't have that kind of self-confidence.I, too, am loving the clear expectations here. I don't need or want to have my hand held, especially vis-a-vis writing of any kind... but I *do* need to know what kind of a goal I'm shooting for, and I think Prof. Rabkin has set that up beautifully.I'm reading once for pleasure and bullet points, a second time for more detailed notes with Dracula, The Left Hand of Darkness and Little Brother, because those are the ones I've never read before and I have the good fortune to be a very quick reader - the others are both shorter and not new to me, so I'm hoping to dive right in with more detailed notes from the start. I already devoured Little Brother in an hour last night (how have I not read any Cory Doctorow before now? He reminds me of Vonnegut, one of my favorite writers of all time), so I'm hoping my ""pleasure"" reads of the others will go similarly.My ""critical reading"" glasses are still a little dusty, but I think Prof. Rabkin has set us all up for success - that's becoming a familiar feeling with Coursera courses, something I never had at my brick and mortar uni!;As a writer, I can absolutely agree with the blank page fear that occurs when you try to start writing something new. Whether it is in electronic form or traditional pen and paper, the white page is an enemy to be slain. I have a tendency to over-write in my beginning process just to get rid of the vast openness of a new page. I will doodle or freewrite or outline, whatever I have to do to feel more secure and safe from the scary first step. It often times ends up looking like a disastrous mess, but it is something! I find that, especially when typing rather than handwriting, just typing as much as you can as an initial thought is very relieving. It is much easier in a word processor than on paper because you can toggle where you want to write next, be it in the middle or at the beginning or in place of something less worthy. Eventually you can shape your jumbled mess of thoughts into something far more gratifying.  ;Although I agree with many of the different views here, my primary concern is that I don't want to risk 'programming' my own way of thinking about a book. I think of it in terms of classical program music; if you are told what the music is supposed to represent, your experience is guided and it becomes more difficult to come up with your own ideas. Like Megan, I will await a response to this question before doing any background reading. I might even avoid reading introductions in the books themselves as I have learnt from experience that sometimes they contain spoilers! :o);Thanks for this, I'll try it out on Thursday.;Oops.

That brought up a window to fill in the details.;o: I'm also working in South Korea,  but I'm originally from New York.;Greetings all,Per the syllabus, here is the link to the translation of the Brothers Grimm ""Children's and Household Tales"" by Lucy Crane. On that website there are several formats available, such as PDF, ePub and MOBI. ePub will work on almost all eBook readers. MOBI will work on a Kindle. There is also an HTML and plain text version, both of which can be read on a computer if you do not have an eBook reader.I had a similar question about the selected readings for this unit, but I believe the selected readings are actually all of the tales in this translation (not just some of them). If this is incorrect, please feel free to update my understanding.  Happy reading, and I look forward to more interaction here in the forum as well as in our peer reviews.;I'd argue that science fiction, like all literature, is evolving. Authors like China Mieville (who just happens to be on the tip of my brain at the moment....) are taking the concept of science fiction to interesting places. For me, science fiction's appeal lies in its ability to examine how people are/could be given the addition or removal of technology. The ""weird fiction"" catalogue fascinates me.... While some sci-fi holds over time, much doesn't. I've been pondering what gives ""staying power"" and what dates.... My current thought is that the author's ability to tell a story that reveals an aspect of humanity is what makes excellent science fiction... Regardless of where Real life science has taken us.... So awesome sci-fi continues to be born..... Just my two cents...... ;Since I'm only 14, my argument might have a lot of holes in it and can be easily crushed, but I agree with Matthew. If you take something like Star Wars, which can be technically be called science fiction, and an episode from the ninth,  tenth or  doctor in television series Doctor Who, one can clearly see the difference. While Star Wars has many elements that can't be directly explained by science, like the force and hyper speed, the tenth doctor explains werewolves as alien parasites, robotic men as being a type of vessel of immortality, and  zombies as being an accident concerning medical nanobots, which  are fantastical elements that can be explained with theoretical science. In conclusion, the genre of science fiction has indeed evolved to rely less on completely fantastical elements. Casey and Matthew,  feel free to correct me.;My favorite Sci-Fi author has always been Philip K. Dick, and largely that's because of the reasons he has for using technological explanations for things he can't actually do. He often describes technology that we actually have today, but didn't when he wrote of it originally. He was a paranoid schizophrenic at the very least, and had to be able to explain not just (Fantasy) that ""they are monitoring him,"" but rather (Sci-Fi) how they are monitoring him. If you remove the technology from his stories, they don't revert to being some sort of Fantasy story, but instead they fall apart completely - the Technology is a character, and needs to be built just like every other character.As far as the Pern books, those seem almost like they'd be right at home in both Sci-Fi and Fantasy. If you remove the technology, the stories don't fall apart but they are no longer the same stories. Pern without technology and science becomes something more similar to Xanth, where everything simply is.I feel like the major difference is similar in nature to the argument between Science and Religion (entirely over-simplified, anyway) with one explanation trying to say exactly how everything was done, and understand it; the other to look at it with awe and wonder. Sometimes, telling a story without explaining the impossible events pushes the story along, and I'd think of a story like that as being Fantasy.When it's all said and done, the two genres definitely have some overlapping room. I would imagine that's why this class seeks to study both.;I think exactly like you about that ""uncanny valley"" feeling because of the fast science and technological progress. What I think has happened to SF is that it has become more difficult to write when focusing on tech and ""action"" more than philosophy and character struggles. I find Neuromancer's ending every bit as appealing now than 10 or 20 years ago, the CODA is just filled with bitterness, but I think that TV and movies SF has been obeying to Hollywod standarsd (mostly) which ends up offering lame remakes of the same ideas.SF's real challenge is to begin dreaming again of the (for HIMYM fans) possimpable. I mean, SF dreamt so much time with many of the things that we have now, or see in the near future, that we need to, once again, propose the ""ridiculous"" stuff that will question our very own humanity as many authors have done (Gibson and Card are some contemporary examples of this done effectively IMHO).What do you think?;I lament that I can only read English, because it definitely hinders my ability to have a wide-range of source material to build my notions from ...;Karen, yes, I do! :) Pester away. Be warned that I know little about the actual coursera site, though - I'm more a hardware/software/OS/accessibility tech geek than a coding/website geek, so any queries about the platform itself are best directed to the appropriate board. While I'm here, the best free screenreader of anything you might pull up in a *browser* that I've found is Chromevox, located here: http://code.google.com/p/google-axs-chrome/It's a browser extension for the Chrome browser, so it's got a fairly small footprint and does a decent job. Unfortunately, it doesn't help with navigating your actual operating system, so anything *outside* of your browser (switching tabs, opening programs, using a word processing document etc) won't be voiced.Similarly, there is a Firefox plugin that has the same benefits (and caveats): http://firevox.clcworld.net/Macs have a program included in the Mac OS itself called VoiceOver, which is far and away the best screenreader that one can have outside of JAWS - it reads anything on the web as well as anything else you're doing on your computer.Windows has a free OS based screenreader too, but it must be downloaded separately, and which screenreading extension to download depends on which version of Windows you're running. Some of them are better than others. None are great.There are tons of screenreaders for Linux, but I don't use Linux, so I'd have to ask my buddy who does for his recommendations.Hope that helps anyone who might need such info.;I suggest you look into Audible for future reference.   It's an Amazon company that offers audio-books for a subscription.   I've downloaded the Android app, but I haven't actually used it yet.From what I saw this evening, I don't think it would be cost-effective for you for this class, as it limits subscribers to 1 book per month.

I'm only now working on the actual essay. But your input has been really helpful.  ;You were actually more helpful than you think. ;);I wanted to pick up on Karen's thought about ""luck"".   I had a professor who showed us the difference between the concept of ""fortune"" in Medieval times versus the concept of ""fortune"" in the Renaissance Era. These stories   are essentiallly Medieval folklore but were complied by the brotheres Grimm in the early ninteenth century. The medieval concept of ""fortune"" is a ""spinning wheel"" and mankind has little influence on their own fate. The Rennaissance concept of fortune, thanks to Machiavelli's The Prince, was that man could make his own fortune and could, to some extent, control his own destiny. I certainly see the medieval ""spinning wheel of fortune"" at work in most of the stories. Just a thought I wanted to add since Karen brought it up.;I agree with you, my mind was going in the same kind of direction.I haven't read all the stories yet, but I've noticed how the message seems to be in some of them: if you want to outstand a noble/king while you're of lower birth, you'll have to be smart.I can take the examples that stricked me so far:- ""The Rabbit's Bride"" - I feel that the Rabbit is the representation of the Lord who takes a part of what his farmers produce and can take a lower born girl if he wants. The girl sacrifize herself to save the garden, but gets away with a clever idea.- ""Six soldiers of fortune"" - The 6 soldiers punish the evil king by joining their very peculiar forces. Being written after the French and American Revolution, I wonder if there's a linked message of the power of the People over a king if he's not good enough???- ""Clever Grethel"" - obviously gets away from his master by a clever twist ;-);I tend to distinguish Science Fiction from Fantasy based on whether it deals more with technology, or more with magic.   So if you like role-playing games, I would classify Shadowrun as Fantasy due to the magical elements, even though it also includes a Cyberpunk / high-technology world.Of course, the quote ""Any sufficiently advanced technology is virtually indistinguishable from magic"" is relevant, and allows the issue to be confused.   I've seen convincing arguments that Star Wars is more fantasy than science fiction, both because of the Force and the strong Jungian archetypal themes.So I think that Utopian and Dystopian novels could be either SF or Fantasy.Are you familiar with S.M. Stirling's Emberverse?   It begins with more of a Science Fiction flavor, and in fact the Nantucket side of the story (""Island in the Sea of Time"" and sequels) continues with a historical fiction / science-fiction time travel flair.However, the United States / Washington State side (""Dies the Fire and sequels) of S.M. Stirling's story quickly becomes dystopian in the first few books.   I still think of the first set as Science Fiction, as it often deals with the technology of survival.   But by the second set of books, the story has become high fantasy, echoing old legends.Eric Flint's ""Ring of Fire"" series is another time-travel / historical fiction, that includes significant discussion of technology.   Even the act of displacing the town in time is explained as alien technology, not ""magic"".   Therefore, I would classify it as science fiction.   But I think I've digressed, since I don't think this series is particularly utopian yet (nor dystopian, but these stories lean hopeful, pointing toward an eventual utopian future).I would classify LeVar Burton's dystopian novel as science fiction, since it deals with technology and a near-future time.   But ""Elementals"", by Morgan Llewellyn, I'd call fantasy.Similarly, I would call ""The Handmaiden's Tale"" a dystopian SF, but ""The Fifth Sacred Thing"" by Starhawk is dystopian fantasy, even though Starhawk tries to build on the world of Handmaiden's Tale.;The boundaries in writing tend to be fairly fluid in my opinion, especially the further you get from fact and into the realms of the fantastical.   Genres are not so much boxes that contain and limit  as they are  puddles, reaching out and melting across attempts to  define borders.  Sci-fi/fantasy is particularly good at this because it's a built-in mechanism, anything is possible from imagining King Arthur  returning to save England in WW2, to  Joss Whedon's Buffy and Firefly series. One of my long-time favourites is Marion Zimmer Bradley's Darkover series in which an exploratory space ship is sent out from modern day  to colonise a distant planet, crashes and is subsequently ""lost"".   Fast forward a couple of centuries, and the colony is thriving, feudalistic and with a system of magic using matrices  which they describe as ""science"" ie ""matrix technology""  with ""technicians"" and ""monitors"".   When they are ""rediscovered"" by the more traditionally  technology-dependent Terrans of the original Earth, tensions ensue around multiple issues, including the consequences and ethics  of embracing certain advances.   For example, ""blasters"" are  banned by Darkover  as they  confer a greatly enhanced advantage to only one opponent; by using bladed articles only, each combatant must place him/herself in danger of injury or death, therefore meeting on equal ground.   With regards to medicine, yes, Terran practices can do wonderful things, such as improved  hygiene and the dispelling of harmful superstitions; but a midwife points out the downside  could include  a newborn with a heart defect who survives through such intervention will require greater care through life, and even pass on the defect to its offspring, requiring yet further intervention; widen that to the population as a whole, and the difficulties become swiftly apparent.   These questions also apply to the Darkovans.   Crucially, their  ""matrix technology"" is itself  linked to biology;  ""laran"" as it is called, is a genetic trait, with a physical presence in the  brain; and their society continues to  suffer from previous generations' attempts to  control and develop ever stronger talents through human breeding programmes which of went horribly wrong.      This series uses the genre of  fantasy  to explore issues around science and technology, ethics, feminism, social interactions, evolution,  languages etc.   Quite a lot is drawn from fact, from the ""real world"",  and what is deemed fantastical shifts depending upon perspective and belief systems.Right, that's my two cents!   :);Sounds like I will have to check out this ""Darkover"" series...thanks Christie!;Though the barrier between ""genre"" literature and mainstream literature is vague, it can never completely disappear. The best sci-fi and fantasy might be chosen by time and promote as the classic ones while the others are left behind and forgotten by the readers. There are some fantasy novels influencing the mass medias significantly now, but I don't think it means that these books are the first rank. The meaning of the distinction between ""genre"" books and mainstream literature is obvious, which is to pick the best ones and discard the mediocre ones no matter whether they are sci-fi and fantasy or not.  ;Wow. I didn't expect to get so many answers with so many good recommendations.  @Karren Abbott I've recently started reading The Hunger Games. I am on the last book, actually. I avoided them for a long time because YA books get popular and then you read them and they're awful. But I was very surprised by these books. Totally not what I was expecting. I thought the movie was really awful though. The thing I find interesting about them, maybe I'm alone here, but they're subdued. You know all these terrible things are going and you keep thinking ""Just defy the Capitol! GO!"" and you know they are but at the same time it's like you're slowly creeping around the corner to get that monster and it's just so calm about it. Maybe it's just me but I just got this subdued sense of urgency from the books.  I know it's not a book but has anyone seen THX 1138? It was a student film George Lucas did back in 1971. It's actually pretty good.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/THX_1138;Thank you for the essay. I know you haven't read it but they do get into the PTSD in the second book. A lot of the kids don't actually go and kill anyone. A lot hide and just get killed. Very few actively kill. They actually bring this up in the second book (I read the first part of the essay. I'll have to read the whole thing when I have time, so I don't know what all they're saying in the essay). SPOILERS AHEAD: In the 75th Hunger Games, it's called the Quell and they do something ""special"". Well, that year they draw from the pool of victors in each District. One of them remarks to Katniss that they all wouldn't be here if they didn't have a killer instinct. Basically that not that many people would/could actually kill when they're put into the situation. That we're not all like that. That's one point I have a problem with straight out that the essay says.  They actually mention a girl who won simply by hiding for the whole games. She never killed anyone. Also, at the beginning of the games, there's this place that they all start out in and they're in a circle around it and at the center is weapons, food, medicine etc. But the catch is, all the strong, well trained ones go for it. So, you can risk your life or head for the hills. Generally around 11-13 people die in the first few minutes. Only the strong or afraid survive.  Sorry, I really like these books and I think they make a lot of good discussion points, whether you agree or not.  ;It is true, Rebecca, that fairy tales have simple narrative structures, as do comic books, TV series and serial novels. These structures make them easy to follow   and probably made them easy to remember and enrich when they were part of the oral tradition.  But doesn't their main attraction lie in the wondrous and magical worlds they portray? ;I've been thinking this over for several days, and I'm not sure how clearly I can articulate this thought yet, so pardon any rambling.I do not enjoy Grimm, and I never have; not even the sanitized versions. However, I *do* get that comforting dopamine rush when reading (or hearing, or reciting) an *Irish* fairy tale - and I'm not sure why that is. I grew up on Grimm and Irish tales in equal measure, so it's not that one holds more nostalgia over the other. The Irish archetypes are not that different from Grimm; threes are prominent, so is nature, the same class issues abound, and on and on. But for some reason, when I *think* fairy tale, I think Cuchulainn, or Fionn MacCumhail and Benandonner, or the Salmon of Knowledge, or The Children of Lir... but if I pick them apart, they hold the same kind of morals and the same general take away messages as the Grimm tales do. I suppose on the most simplistic level, I find Irish fairy tales more interesting or more enjoyable... but I can't even deconstruct why *that* is.I am almost afraid to think about it too much, lest I get distracted from what we're *supposed* to be writing about... I'd much rather deconstruct the Irish ones!;Hitler came much later than the Grimms and German nationalism, so you might need to revisit that hypothesis.   Remember, 'Deutschland ueber alles' meant 'Germany as a whole comes before Schleswig-Holstein' before it meant 'Germany conquers the world'.;It may be partly about the memory of being read to. Read these tales aloud to someone else, and they take on an entirely different quality. There's something very dreamlike about them, some mapping onto the unconscious even when we're annoyed by the amoral or malicious character coming out on top, or a repetition of ridiculously rigid gender roles, or the apparent lack of logic.;I would offer another perspective. We love these stories, in a way that we don't (some could say can't) love other stories. If for no other reason than these were given us at developing periods prior to critical analysis, of both literature and our world in general. They speak to us because they have become archetypal and fundamental. On a quick aside, I once heard a literary anarchist (I forget the fellow's name) in Berkeley who spoke of the pagan roots of Disney's versions of the stories, he said that Disney was the most counter-cultural icon in the 20th century namely because he got 'Christians' to love old pagan tales...an argument could be made in many regards his assertion (for instance the initial artwork added Christian images), but I've always found the idea compelling (much in line with JK Rowling's, Potter series as well).;"

Given the events of the novel, it made me want to turn off my flat screen TV and pick up a book... which I did. I like to think Mr. Bradbury would have been proud.;I'm Meg, from Atlanta, Georgia, US - but born and raised in Michigan, so I'm excited to be taking a U of M course! I'm a fiction writer whose work predates the internet (so, unfortunately, you can't find it anywhere) and a medical nerd who had to leave university over a decade ago due to my own medical issues - so I joke that I ""peaked"" in my senior year of high school. :) I'm currently writing a novel while trying to get myself healthy enough to attend university full time without crashing and burning... both are a slow process. Thirteen years, five or six drafts, and probably 500,000 to a million pages later, I'm just now getting to something workable, novel-wise.Needless to say, I love to read and write, and I'm looking forward to learning a lot in this course.;Go blue indeed! My grandfather once put his fist through the television during an Ohio St/U of M game - things were going badly, apparently. And my stepmother went to Ohio St... so there's a week out of the year where no one on that side of the family speaks to each other! Meanwhile, when I go back ""home"" to Grand Rapids, they call me a Georgia peach (I have, over 20 odd years, picked up a slight southern twang that is only noticeable to Midwesterners), but in Georgia, they still call me a d*** Yankee. At least I still carry a map of my home state right on my hand. :);Hi Kimberly and Jenny, I live in Lawrenceville (Gwinnett Co, near the Mall of GA). Your accent is probably very close to mine! After 24 years, fellow Midwesterners who live here still randomly say, ""Hey, you're from Michigan!"" but when I go up north, I can hear that slight southern edge to my vowels. Then, of course, there's the fact that asking for ""pop"" got me ""what?!"" down here, so I switched to calling everything Coke (orange coke, pepsi coke, etc)... so now when I go back to MI, people look at me funny and say ""We don't have Coke, you want pop?"" D'oh!I pick up accents *very* easily and unintentionally (I tend to code-switch without thinking about it), so I *should* have a full on southern accent after all these years, but as a kid, I was upset at leaving ""my lake"" (Lake Mich) and thus determined to never sound southern... but nowadays it makes me feel a little like a person without a country, lol!I keep thinking about moving back to go to college at U of M - or maybe Grand Valley State, where I spend my summers at wheelchair sports camp (first as a camper, now as a counselor/mentor) and where I have more family - but I think the weather might kill me. Snow and ice are not kind to wheelchair users!;I usually have the opposite problem; I'm too succinct and fail to reach the minimum without needing to repeat myself. I'm grateful for the opportunity to have my skill for short-form essays challenged.;I'm going to take down my bulletpoints *as* I read, and then when I'm finished with the book, I'll have a list to cull and expand on.This is pretty much the tack I'm going to take, too.When I was at college mmmmph (OK, over 20) years ago, I really struggled with what the expectations of lecturers were and how to go about writing effective essays. Over the years, I've discovered that for me bullet pointing makes everything alright. It's much easier for me to jot things down, connect the dots, and merge points when the ideas are separated out that way. It also took being out of education for many years to gain the confidence to just ask what is expected and how best to meet that expectation (or run like the clappers from it).  It's marvellous to have really clearly stated expectations AND a slew of resources to help us meet them. The video clips and the student essay portfolios on the wiki are immensely helpful and reassuring.  I've never taken notes *as* I read before. ... stopping to take notes threw me out of the story (and I love story!). This time around though, technology has made taking notes significantly less physically difficult, so I have a better chance of remembering to tap things out along the way.I  understand how stop-start reading breaks the flow. I find it impossible to read anything first time round while taking notes. My plan is to read once for pleasure, make some bullet points about overall impressions, then read again while taking notes.;Oh, I hear you on class and academia! Though the late 60s and 70s saw a lot of university fees paid for by the state in the UK, and so a lot more working class academics were in place by the late 80s, there was still a real skew towards the culture of the public school when I was there. I just continuously assumed I was wrong or stupid or just incompetent, whereas now I know that there was a systemic failure to transition kids from ordinary state schools to universities. Some of my lecturers were really great, and one gave extra-curricular classes on writing for his course, but the overwhelming majority were, I think, blissfully unaware that any of us needed any support.I reckon a bunch of people I was at uni with got their degrees despite the obstacles, not because they got help. I dropped out due to chronic illness, but ended up hanging out with a bunch of academics later in life more by accident than anything. Most of them had undergone similar experiences, and were determined that their students wouldn't suffer the same fate. I learned enough of The Rules second-hand from them to stop beating myself up for having ""failed"". I have a whole patented rant about institutionalised dysfunctional behaviours I have observed as I watched friends go through the post-grad grinder.I need to get on to the Doctorow. He's the only author on the list I haven't read, and yet he's been recommended to me by so many people it's ridiculous. Vonnegut, you say? I'm sold.;I'm quickly skimming through the student portfolios available on the course wiki to get a flavour of the diversity in style and focus to expect - as well as to reassure myself about the process of writing for the course! I'd recommend it as an exercise in reassurance as well as building excitement :);I didn't write notes in any of the books.From memory,  a child has doodled on one of the pages of Alice in Wonderland but that just adds to the charm!Regards;Russell T Davies did wonders for Doctor Who.;RTD is certainly awesome and would go as far as to say his time on DW changed the face of SF on television.  ;Wow! That is wonderfully sweet of you, thank you so much! I may very well take you up on that, as my own explorations of my computer have yielded little in the way of useful voice features. I actually did manage to get my hands on an audio copy of le Guin's book -- about the only one so far. Thank you so much for the offer! If you can help me figure out some screen reading options for Windows XP, that would be fantastic. I tried it yesterday, but the voice only wanted to read my tool bar, not the document I was looking at. I've been thinking of looking into programs like JAWS and Dragon, but my computer is on its last legs and I'm pretty sure I don't want to buy more software for XP, only to have to upgrade to Windows 8 and reinstall everything. So right now I'm stuck with only what came with my operating system. ;All but the Le Guin are available for free on Project Gutenberg, where you can download for Kindle and read onscreen.LibriVox may have some of the audio books for free - I recall the Grimms' and Carroll's work being there.Megan, you realise you've just outed yourself as one of those people that technologically-challenged folk like me pester for information, right?Update:In this thread, there's a discussion of free audio books for the course from LibriVox:  https://class.coursera.org/fantasysf-003/forum/thread?thread_id=35  So far, people say  Carrol, Stoker, Shelly are definitely available there.;This is great stuff to be aware of and share.;I don't think there is an absolute answer to your question, Claire, but I'll give you my opinion. By Katrina's definition above, and by the one given by Prof. Rabkin, as you point out, *all* fiction is fantasy - at least, all *good* fiction should ""invite suspension of reality."" Even if a novel is a ""slice of life"" work, by its very nature, it is a fictional world, and not actual events that happened in anyone's reality - otherwise it would be a biography.As someone who writes ""slice of life,"" I've been asking myself your question since seeing the first set of videos. Is, then, what *I* write fantasy?Yes and no.Yes, in the sense that it is all a fictional (and hopefully immersive) world. One that closely resembles our own, but in which the protagonists deal with Big Things perhaps more often than average. Sometimes those things are good, sometimes they are bad. Sometimes the characters win, and sometimes not. The biggest way in which my ""universe"" differs from the real one is that the protagonists are rather better communicators than Joe Average. They are not preternaturally so in any way; rather, being good communicators is a survival skill and a cultural talent they value, so it's something they've worked to cultivate. But that's the most fantastic thing about them. Well, that and the fact that they're meant to be dead.No no, don't misunderstand, they're human. A hundred percent human. They just should be dead by *now*. No, it's not Tuck Everlasting. They're just regular people, leading regular lives... but they both have a disease which should have killed them long ago, and it hasn't. No, it's not a supernatural or special disease. It exists in this world. And they're not particularly strong, or healthy, for that matter - just lucky. Like many thousands of people who wake up every day and go about their daily lives when statistics say they should be dead. Some of the plot is about how they cope with that - most of it isn't.I have explained my ""universe"" in this way for a reason - if I did my ""job,"" did you notice how quickly you were willing to accept that there might be something fantastical going on? And yet, they are very average people with, for the most part, average lives. But part of a writer's job is to capture your attention and your imagination at the same time. To say, ""Come with me....and trust me."" If you can't get the reader to come along, your work is for naught. But once they've come along, they have to trust that you're going to lay out some rules, any rules, and abide by them.   The rules can be as mundane or ridiculous as the author likes, but they have to stay consistent within the narrative. Now that I've told you why my characters aren't dead, and emphatically explained that there is no supernatural cause, it would be cheap for me to say, ""but actually, they're secretly vampires."" I'd be breaking the rules I set out, and thus breaking the ""contract"" between myself and the reader(s). At the same time, hopefully the reader has that little niggle in the back of their mind - why are *these* people alive? Why those specific people? Is there possibly a reason that even the protagonists haven't uncovered? Or is the universe just that fickle? That is one of the spaces in which I play. I like that sandbox.So that's how all fiction *can* be fantasy - done well, it primes you to accept anything. (What would be the point of reading Sherlock if, in the back of your mind, you didn't wonder if *this time* he might miss something? You trust that in the end, he'll solve the mystery - he's Sherlock Holmes! But maybe, just maybe...)Here then is why what I write *isn't* fantasy - there's nothing otherworldly in it. By the common definition, fantasy must contain at least one *impossible* (not just unlikely) element. Harry Potter has magic. C.S. Lewis has Narnia. Naomi Novik has talking dragons fighting historical battles in the Air Force. My protagonists aren't impossible, since, as I said, they have a real disease with real consequences that real people in this world have survived for extraordinary periods, too. Not impossible, just unlikely.By the latter measure, Sherlock Holmes and other such characters (Poirot, etc) are fantasy because they belong more to the world of archetype than reality. As much as you think they *might* fail (and that's important, because without it, there is no dramatic tension), you trust that they *won't* fail. It would break the rules (and shatter your trust) to read a Great Detective story where the detective bumbles around, stomps on the evidence, blows the case, and at no point saves the day.... all because he hasn't had his coffee.That's why the latter metric is more useful to me; and probably more practical to use in the everyday world. But I do like the idea that all good fiction is fantasy in its own way, simply because a good writer can (and might) take you anywhere.;Thank you all for taking the time to respond. Megan, your illustration was the light I needed, thank you. I feel more comfortable going forward now. I will enjoy relating the stories in the reading list to this new thought about the 'limits' of fantasy. I will have to look out for your stories as well. I write only fact and read only fiction :)   ;Interesting point Megan. I had read, among the many things said about 50 shades, that it began life as vampire fiction.  When it comes to using genre as a selling point it is tricky subject. When people look for books they start with genre, how will your book be found? Even factual books can be difficult to categorize. Unfortunately difficult to categorize books don't sell well.  ;Megan,That is good advice for peer reviewers. I never said, though, that I wanted the process to change, and I already gave an example of another class that does not have to go to this extreme. I am not telling the professor how to run his class, as everyone seems to think. I simply stated that I was confused and if the grading is a specific way, I would not fully participate. That is my choice. I understand everything that's been said, but this goes against what I stand for as a student and as a teacher. I am still excited to learn from the professor and the peers, just not through the writing assignments.  ;My concern would have been that you dropped out without giving it a fair chance, Katrina.   Don't leave before we get to play with you!   ;Megan - I 100% agree with you in re: Irish folk tales. I would argue that they are more complete. Characters are complex, have struggles to overcome (or fail to overcome....). The story arcs are complete. There is a sense of realistic consequences to actions....;Anahita, it's an interesting topic you've started. It's a question I've been asking to myself for a long time, as fairy-tales are the only literature from my childhood that I can read again and again and it doesn't matter if I know the plot already or not. I think one of the reasons is their simplicity. You don't have to make your brain sweat to understand what's written there and then, as they lack lots of details, there is room for your own imagination and it's definitely pleasant to build up all these castles, forests, wicked witches and princesses in your mind.;Theres a lot of fantasy and Sci fi to enjoy, The Power Rangers were one of my favorites and Lightspeed and TimeForce are still good if you are into them.Animated Fantasy and Sci Fi besides anime that are good today:Adventure Time just some boschian random sh*t happening all the timeBen 10 it is a great concept well executed in the first seasonTeen Titans (not the new one) and Young Justice if you like DC comicsAvengers Earth Mightiest Heroes if you like Marvelsome years ago some french cartoons boomed and quality tv rised with good shows like Totally Spies and Code LyokoAnime:Shiki contemporary rural town gets vampedAnything Gundam, specially 00 or the originalCode GeassGuilty CrownIRL Sci fi and fantasy are sort of harder to get but Stargate and Game of Thrones are still airing, and of course Battlestar Galactica reason enough to own a netflix account and watch and rewatch it till time ends.;"

The True Bride and the Maiden Without Hands are two that stand out, hopefully they are included in the Lucy Crane edition!;I am confused and concerned about the grading process of the essay assignments. In the only other Coursera course I have taken, the students were given credit for the peer assessments they did, but the grades were not counted toward any official grade for the course. The peer assessments were used for feedback only, and often valuable, but in many cases, not so much. I tried to read about the peer assessments in this course, but it is rather confusing. Are the grades given by peers counted as part of our overall, official grade, or are we just given credit for doing them? If the former is the process for this course, I will not participate in the essays. As an educator myself who uses peer evaluations in my own classes, I would never allow the grades given by other students to be the official grade or part of the official grade at the end of a class. The answer to this question will determine whether or not I participate fully in this course, so a timely answer would be greatly appreciated!;Lol, this thread made me laugh.   Y'all are reading into things far too deeply.   Just read the books, get your peer essays and give your honest views.   You are going to get a ""pass"" or ""fail"" on the basis of doing your work.   Anything more than that is a bonus!   But more's the point - why are you doing this course if it is not to expand your mind?   ;It's a better and more remarkable story if he gets paid in gold--and it really stands out in the collection because there are no talking animals, magical witches, prophetic princesses, or mountains of glass involved.

Thank you so much for the tip, Byurakn!;Those tales do  not only reflect the society and the time during which they were written, but they also had a huge impact on people's life.  I imagine how this way of looking at  life  highly encouraged marrying  your very first love... Or more dramatic... Made girls easily accept to marry the first man who asked for  their hand.Stories are very powerful vectors of ideas. They can highly influence a whole generation. They can be used in many different ways. I tend to comment the stories I read to my kids and ask them questions to help them think critically about the story. I prefer stories which will empower my children.Traditional tales  including princesses and dragons  are highly interesting and part of our culture... But... ""How to train a dragon"" reflects today's ideals. I read so so so many times all my fairy books when I was a kid, and I had plenty of very traditional ones in original versions... They had a huge influence on me. Maybe not always a good one, because I did not live in the same world anymore... And, being able to think about them critically came later I believe. But I have to say that they did nourish my imagination from a very young age. Little Red Cap from the Grimm was inspired from  Little Red Ridding Hood  first written by Charles Perrault. But, Charles Perrault did not invent that story which  used to be told in families the evening near the fire. It evolved sort of in a darwinian way... slowly from old myths... Most stories tell how to survive in the world...  (Don't follow strangers...) Stories can save.  Stories can cure, Stories can do so many things, really...    When you tell a story... Be aware of its power... Make good use of it...;I didn't read the Six Soldiers of Fortune as a model of teamwork, more of how the soldiers were greedy and deceitful. I'm going to have to go back and read this one again to see if I can find the optimism in the character's actions. :-) Thanks!;I think the reason the story doesn't portray the soldiers as greedy is hidden in the beginning of the story: these soldiers fought for a king, but the king did not reward them afterwards as he should have.For a contemporary parallel in the US, see the current backlog of VA claims for veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan.   You could imagine retelling the story with a brigade of veterans storming Washington and carrying off medical supplies or something.;This is an ongoing problem for me as I teach successive on-line courses, i.e., forgetting where all the dates are and resetting them for the next class.

Not only mothers but women in overall too like in ""The Fisherman and his Wife"" and put in the bad light like in ""Clever Grethel"". Evil witches...Where are the bad men? One example is the King in the story of soldiers, other the The Wonderful Musician. The second still concerns me, why the Musician was not punished.PS. I apologise for spelling mistakes if any in the stories' titles.;Although I do not agree with everything you said, the first point you made regarding the causes are exactly what i was going for. The thought that the kings had a right to rule is a given, because if you think about it, when someone is rich and has everything handed out to him/her just because he/or she was born to someone already with power, then that can only mean that that person is in fact lucky, from birth. On the other hand, that would mean that people who weren't lucky to be born like that would have to accomplish great deeds in order to change their status (because being born again into a different family and strata is not an option).That being said, I cannot agree when you say that people of low birth have their skills taught o them. So far, from what I have read, it seems those people already have those skills and they just never noticed or actually used them to their advantage. Take the story of the little tailor who killed seven flies with one strike for example; one cannot assume he only found out he had all that cunning in him by killing a bunch of flies, that was just the motto for the story to start, an excuse for him to have something to brag and make himself noticed.;Hmmm. Is there a history of matriarchy in Northern Europe? I don't remember learning that (though it's entirely possible that I am simply unaware....).;Hi Byurakn, Yes, I hadn't noticed that. You are right, the simplicity is part of it. The way they portray the human, is devoid of complexity, too. I just finished reading a very modern novel, Little Brother, and comparing the two works, I can definitely see this. And also conflicts are resolved withing fairy tales without much dwelling. Like in that horrifying faithful John, the horrific decision the king makes at the end about his children, is made in a line. It makes me think of the contemporary debate on free will. As much as some of the tales are morality tales, the way they are presented sides with the system view of free will, that each person, the system that he is, behaves and decides in a certain way, not much dwelling. Cinderella is kind and obedient by nature. She doesn't dwell on whether or not to confront the stepmother. If some character shows a change, it's due to seeing the result of what he has done, like in the raven. Then his system changes to another one.  Very illuminating thought,Thanks;"

None of the marks we gave the papers counted in the final grade, but it certainly made the school look foolish. So, I can see why Katrina might have a question about this type of grading.;"

You may see social mobility based on skill and courage in working men and beauty and sweetness in working women, but the women in that group have to be sweet and beautiful while suffering, where the men have to be brave and clever. Sometimes princesses have to be chucked out of the castle to prove how sweet and beautiful they are while suffering. But, by and large, it's all about the high status men being already entitled to their luck and the low status men having to earn it. It's very socially conservative.I think it's a cracking thesis.;Fabio, I hate to be the bearer of negative counter points, but I can think of another one besides ""The Frog Prince"". In the story ""The Knapsack, The Hat, and The Horn"" the main protagonist is a very poor boy who becomes successful through the luck of him finding a magical table cloth. His luck continues as he continues to find powerful magical items that he is able to steal, and use to eventually become king. I could be wrong, so do correct me if I am.;Byurakn, I think you're onto something... If one of them hadn't been there, the whole thing would have fallen apart. And yes, Sydney, that is one of the exceptions I was referring to.Fabio, that's a valid point right there. Although, I DID assume he found out about his skill by killing a bunch of flies. Perhaps I should re-read that. Thanks.That being said, I would like to point out that I was taking all of fantasy into account, not just the Grimms. Uhmmm... Let me get back from the office and I'll illustrate a few examples on this.... but if this is intended for your thesis (and that should cover just the Grimms) then perhaps I'm overreaching. ;There's definitely snobbery and social discrimination in the tales.   When there's a King's daughter's hand in marriage up for grabs and the challenge is met by a 'lucky' poor person, the King or his daughter always go back on their word and it's only by continuing to meet extra challenges set for them that the King or his daughter seem to give up and allow the peasant into their social class.;Oh, good! :);Oooh - Peggie, that's great!I don't know about German history, but I do know that the Vikings had a concept of hamingja  which was a part of the self connected with luck which could   be passed on to descendants and even loaned out. It seems the Norse viewed the self as a sort of gestalt entity comprised of various components that could be detached at will. The Saxons seem to have viewed the web of Wyrd  as the unfolding of fate, which had strings which could be tugged on to alter your luck - as long as you were exceptionally careful about it.;I think your thesis more or less applies to both genders.;I guess it's optional. I wouldn't share the final draft, but the idea, if you are in doubt.  ;I love the idea of your thesis, and I agree with others about the viewpoint at the time of the creation of the stories with nobility being considered to rule by divine right and perhaps continuing the round of luck they had beginning at birth to be born into their class. To that point, from the view point of the story tellers, who were probably all lower class, nobles were the lucky ones never having to work for anything while the commoners had to work to accomplish anything in their lives. It strikes me as a simple fact of existence for them and a lesson to the youngsters telling them they'll have to work for everything.;"

The hare is in some places associated with the moon and the moon is also linked to agrary cicles.  ;Hi, Here is my assignment:The Grimm Brothers' Fairy tale    THE WOLF AND THE SEVEN GOSLINGS    makes evident the semantic proximity of the symbols which represent the mother and the symbols which represent the death. When the goose mother departs to find food for her children, she advices they about the perils of death represented by the Wolf. In her advice the wolf can be recognized by the hoarse voice and the black paws. While the hoarse voice is an extension of the nibbling symbolism through the mouth image, the black paws integrate both the aggressive animal symbolism and the night/darkness symbolism. In according to the french anthropologist Gibert Durand animal and dark symbols might be understanding as the faces of death when negatively valued. The same kind of symbols when it   s euphemized and positively valued can represent the mother. For example, when the night brings a sensorial realism which induces comfort and when the action of biting become to swallow without hurting but protecting.   So when the wolf tries to disguise himself as the goose mother, the horrible aspects of his animalism and his darkness are precisely the elements which reveal him. But when he can disguise these specific aspects he can trick the little gooses and, not incidentally, he look likes their mother.On the other hand, it   s just because the death symbols are symmetric to mother/birth symbols and also because the digestive stomach is symbolically confused with the sexual belly and so with the womb which generates and protect the life that the mother goose can rescue her children of the wolf stomach.   The wolf who swallows the gooses seems to be pregnant of they and the goose mother can bring her children from the death to the life in a new birth .  Thank you for your comments.;"

However, I   m not sure if I can help you in anything, as my writing knowledge in English if far below yours.   Anyway, the initiative is great. If I can help in any way, please count on me.

All your ideas do not have to take off every time, but the possibility has to always be there.   When an idea hits it hits big generating far more value than your long string of small wins and losses.    Fortunately there is a new book, Berger   s Contagious on what qualities are needed for an idea to takeoff.   This book proposes six key concepts which can lead to an idea taking off, which are summarized in the acronym STEPPS:           S     Sociality Currency         T     Triggers           E     Emotion           P     Public           P     Practical Value           S -- Stories    This analysis is very encouraging because the elements fit the type of work we are proposing very well.     Here are some key points on how we can use each of the six STEPPS:       1.           S     Sociality Currency:   We need to make our ideas something people will want to tell their friends.        2.           T     Triggers:   This is about making the idea something that immediately brings positive images to the mind.   What we are proposing are believable space exploration adventures that most people can identify with.          3.           E     Emotion:   This is about the idea directly bringing up positive emotions.   The awe of space and the call of adventure are powerful emotions we will rely on.        4.           P     Public:   This is about people accepting the idea as part of their public persona and not just their inner self.   Most people feel it is Ok to be for Space.   The percentage is through the roof for technical people.        5.           P     Practical Value:   This is about seeing the idea as positive and good for society.   Apollo to the Moon was on most lists of the best thing in 20th century.   There is every reason to think that we can make a major space exploration adventure one of the best things in 21st century.        6.           S     Stories:   This is about communicating with people in a way that they enjoy relating too.   This is what our test project is all about.   The trick then is to turn these abstract concepts into direct action and stories that we can test in the market place.   It is all about Do.

Diversity: Having high expectations about diversity means that  you want to work with people from a variety of backgrounds and/or  with varied points of view.  Recognition: Having high expectations about recognition means  that you want a work environment where good work is  acknowledged and rewarded.  Autonomy: Having high expectations about autonomy means that  you want to have the independence or freedom to make decisions  about how you will do your job.  Environment: Having high expectations about environment  means that you see a connection between the social and physical  work environment and your well-being.  Expression: Having high expectations about expression means  that you want a work environment that allows you to share your  opinions and feelings openly.  Teamwork: Having high expectations about teamwork means that  you expect collaboration to be a highly valued and commonly used  method for reaching work objectives.  Stability: Having high expectations about stability means that you  want job security and a work environment that remains relatively  unchanged.Balance: Having high expectations about balance means that you  have personal and professional goals and that you want others to  understand the importance of all of your commitments.  Career Growth: Having high expectations about career growth  means that you want to make progress toward your professional  goals.   2001 by Inscape Publishing, Inc.

Tom, the project sounds fascinating.;I don't know that my taste in Fantasy is particularly mature but, I love anything by Anne McCaffery, J.R.R. Tolkien or C.S. Lewis. I'm a busy mom so books I can read to my children such as The Hobbit and The Chronicles of Narnia get extra points. As far as sci-fi goes, I love Peter F. Hamilton. He's dark but really drags you into a story.;I liked ""The Raven"", where the girl is determined this dude is going to be her hero, and gives him like a million chances to save her!   There's no way of knowing exactly how old these stories are, or how the original story actually went.   I think it's interesting--were these stories considered fashionable or innovative or risque when they were originally told?   When the Grimms collected these stories, were they considered old news?   It's also interesting to ponder what changes may have occurred....perhaps the ""needle"" and other inanimate objects were actually meant to portray certain people the storyteller knew?;Great question for discussion.   I am enjoying the answers, thoughts and thinking on this.   But I think nothing is set in stone, that the definitions for the fantasy genre are like the definitions of poetry that one adheres to which says more about the values, aestetics, culture, education and even time period (and a myriad of other factors) in which the poet is writing than it does about the absolute properties of the what poetry is, or can be.;Being concerned about the issue myself, I will avidly await the answer along with you. Having said that, I won't allow it to influence my decision to try and take everything I can out of the course. Of course, not every critique is helpful - as an aspiring writer who participates in online writing groups I know that all too well - but not venturing out there to see if maybe something constructive comes my way too seems even less productive.Not trying to persuade, just my opinion;I assumed that the essays are graded independently by staff at the university and that we are only grading them as an exercise to give us practice at critically evaluating people's responses to the texts. It would seem odd if the final grade was influenced by the feedback that students would give other students and that this is used to measure our participation in the course and it is taken into consideration for the final grade in that way. I don't consider myself qualified to ""mark"" other people's work in a way that contribute to their final grade so I can't see the grades we give other students to be part of it. It would be better if it was clarified though to avoid confusion. ;Katrina, I understand your issue with the grading and I respect your issues with it. This situation reminds me of an issue I've had in my own courses when trying (forcing?) students to understand the benefits of peer review. The ideal is that students, when acting as reviewers, learn to become better critics of ideas and their own writing by having something more tangible than participation points at stake. When my students felt they were being held accountable by other students for their own grades and were accountable for the grades they gave others, they handled peer review with a new sense of seriousness and purpose. Further, my students reported that it made them feel like they were actually contributing to knowledge both on content and form by helping their peers. They began to see themselves as part of a scholarly community Instead of feeling like high schoolers being given inane tasks to complete. It helped them refine their scholarly voices and gain security in the fact that they could (and needed to!) provide thought-provoking and critical analysis to their peers - a skill necessary both in the classroom, on blog posts/forums, and in the greater community while in the workplace or over a beer. I've interpreted Prof. Rabkin's grading criteria in light of these experiences in my own classroom. It's not the most ideal situation to base a course ""grade"" on only peer-reviewed material, but I think it helps develop the scholarly community he's aiming for given the skills he wants us to have at the end of the course. With your Mythology course, I wonder what would stop a ""robot"" to be built that fills in all the blanks with Lorem Ipsum instead of a real, flesh student writing critically on the assigned materials? While there could be a system implemented where reviewers ""flag"" posts like that, if I, as a student, saw multiple ones like that in the span of the course, I'd start questioning the legitimacy of the course and Coursera as a medium. (not to say I've seen this happen, but just to pose a hypothetical). I look forward to your thoughts on this as a fellow educator!;As a fellow teacher, encouraging students to take this course, that is also my take Danielle. Professor explained very well what was required and how it will improve the skill set of all students taking this course.  ;Yeah, I think you are raising a fair point, Katrina. I had similar concerns (along the lines of ""would students know what they're doing?"") the first time I came across it here on Coursera, but so far I have nothing but good experiences with it. A professor in another course said that after looking through the results from a previous version of his course, it turned out that students mark each other very similarly to what he himself would have done.This being said, you, or anyone else, should certainly bring it up again if the feedback you're getting is unfair. :);(N.B. I am not a teacher nor a professional of any stripe - below are just my personal experiences.)I too was concerned about peer review when I first found coursera. It makes practical sense to use it, thanks to the huge enrollment numbers, and I'm sure in the aggregate, the peer review grades average out to something fair.In the previous class I've taken (Dr. Hagen's fantastic AIDS course) I found that my final grade accurately reflected my work as a whole. That said, there were a few essays where the peer reviewers took off points, and then could not comment coherently as to why.  In the case of one particular essay, it was obvious that my word choices had outstripped the knowledge of three different non-native English speakers; all three left comments that demonstrated they either hadn't read, or hadn't understood my essay. I felt bad about the misunderstanding; I respect anyone who has the drive to take a class in a second (third, fourth, etc) language! But at the same time, I was upset about essentially being ""punished"" for delving into the topic in greater depth. I found myself writing with very simple language and striving to make my points blatantly obvious (and not in a good way - things like literally writing ""The first statement significant to me is.... the second statement significant to me is...."") for the rest of the course, so as to not find myself penalized due to a peer's difficulties in reading English.Even with that, one person whose English was perfect docked a later essay for ""not having a thesis or conclusion."" Fair enough, except, since this was after I'd already decided to break out the sledgehammer and abandon all subtleties, the essay in question included blinking neon signs in the form of that awful phrase, ""I will argue that A, B, C"" and the close second in terms of pedestrian tell-not-showing phrases, ""In conclusion...""I just might have had to walk away from the computer for several minutes the afternoon that review came back. And count to a hundred. And remind myself I was still going to get a very good grade, so it didn't matter much. But arrrrgh.But the grading system as a whole is not going to change, because it can't practicably use professors and TAs to grade however many thousand essays are at stake.Some advice, therefore, for my fellow peer reviewers, especially those whose written English skills are not very strong (you can be a native English speaker and still have difficulty with the written word - ask anyone who's dyslexic!):Read slowly and carefully.Read the whole essay. Then read it a second time. Make sure you understand what the writer is trying to say. (There was a lot of whining in the AIDS class that people just didn't have *time* to read *so many* (5) essays! I'm sympathetic to that, but if you don't have the time to evaluate your peers *carefully* - as carefully as you yourself would hope to be graded - then please, don't participate in the essay portion of the class.)If you don't understand what the writer is trying to say, ask yourself whether they are writing unclearly, or whether your reading comprehension might be the issue. If you are a non-native speaker, dyslexic, if you're *grading* someone who might be a non-native English speaker or dyslexic, or if you're in a rush despite yourself, you owe it to your classmates to be *especially* careful to make sure you haven't missed something. If a writer uses a word you don't know, look it up. If that sheds no light, ask on the boards... many people will be happy to help. Yo no hablo espa  ol bien en estos d _as, pero puedo leer lo suficientemente bien como para ayudar a los estudiantes que necesitan un poco de ayuda de la traducci _n. (hopefully I have conjugated that *mostly* correctly or my tio will be very disappointed with me! :) )By all means, critique - that is the point of this class, for learning cannot take place without criticism. But make sure it's ""attentive, intelligent"" criticism, to borrow from Prof. Rabkin. ""I didn't like this"" or ""you didn't do this well"" aren't helpful. ""I found the middle of your essay confusing because A doesn't seem to have much to do with B"" is a helpful comment. The same applies to ""good""... not helpful. ""I liked what you said about food meanings, it made me see the text in a different way."" That's helpful. You don't have to write a long or complicated comment to be helpful, just say something interesting. If you are a non-native speaker who finds commenting difficult in English, by all means, type your comment into google translate and paste the English translation into the comment box. I would rather get a very thoughtful comment in computer-translated English than a ""good"" or ""not good"" from a self conscious reviewer.And finally, just to reiterate, I have *profound* respect for the non-native English speakers taking this course. I could not take a course in Spanish or Irish (my two other languages) at this level and follow along. I also want to acknowledge that there are plenty of non-native English speakers out there whose English skills are better than mine - I tip my hat to you, too.If we all respect each other and do our best work (with reviewing as well as writing), everything will work out fine.;Katrina,I fully understand your reservations, believe me! I still share them - that's why I would *never* sign up for the signature track (which involves paying a significant amount of money to take the same class and have your grade considered certified and accredited) for a class like this. I simply don't trust the peer review system that much! I was just taking the opportunity on a thread about peer reviewing to elaborate on how those of us who *will* be participating in the peer review portion can do our best to be fair and informed toward our classmates. I completely respect your decision, and I wish there were easier ways for MOOCs like Coursera to deal with graded essays. I'm embarrassed to admit it, but I don't think I would put nearly as much effort into a ""participation only"" essay as a graded one - in a classroom, as part of a for-credit course, I would, but for a free course that isn't for any credit, I would struggle to feel like the work I put in *meant* something if all I got at the end was a ""yeah, you typed something in the box.""I suspect that a peer review system is the best out of a bunch of not-great options for Coursera as a whole. Individual Coursera classes might have better options to fit that specific material - for example, in the AIDS class, we discussed the possibility of making a ""dual track"" available - one for people who didn't want to write essays/didn't feel comfortable with peer review, and one for people who wanted to write essays and/or didn't feel comfortable with quizzes being their only coursework. One of my other classes is quizzes only, and for that material, it works fine. Peer review that doesn't actually count for a grade would demotivate *me*, but that doesn't make it an invalid option. And so on.I certainly didn't feel like you were trying to tell the professor how to run his class. I've witnessed people *actually* doing that, and those people have never been as polite as you are. In addition to that, I've known a lot of educators in my life (my mother is a school bus driver and I've worked as an informal paraprofessional in special ed classrooms off and on for many years, as our district is chronically shorthanded in that area), and I know no educator who would think of doing such a thing!So, no worries. Your point of view is well taken and was well expressed. Don't worry about the rude commenters - such is the way of the internet. Enjoy the class!;One of Vertigo's tamer series and I still love it. Personally Jack of Fables is my favourite, his personality straddles the line between the darker and lighter side of fairy tales.  ;I've read a bunch of them, and really love them. Along with Sondheim's Into the Woods, Fables is among my favorite ""fractured fairy tales.""I just recently mentioned them on my blog.  http://stackedshelves.blogspot.com/2013_04_01_archive.html;I used to read them, I guess I read until issue number 80 or so. It's a wonderful comic series but very hard to find in Mexico.  ;I Katrina. What I'd like to know is what stories do we have to read for next week....there's a LOT of them.I used that website to learn Danish, you can have the same tale written in two different language one besides the other, so you can compare them.By the way, I remember your name, but I am not sure from which course...Greek Mythology?;I see that we've got a GoodReads group, so I created one for LibraryThing too:http://www.librarything.com/groups/fantasyandscienceficAnd here's my (woefully incomplete) profile there:http://www.librarything.com/profile/nadyne.richmond;Hello, here goes my (rather incomplete) list:Movies (in no particular order):  -SF:MatrixAnimatrixAvalonDonnie DarkoAkira12 Monkeys  -Fantasy:Spirited Away.Princess Mononoke.Nausicaa.Howl's Moving Castle.LOTR The two towers.About TV series I think I do not know a lot but as more people bring them up, I'll remember them. Neon Genesis Evangelion would be there, as well as Last Exile and Gundam Wing. Game of Thrones would also appear on my list.;I haven't read the book (which I hope to find soon), butI particularly like what Studo Ghibli does, although anime as a general rule is not what I most like, I saw a fair share some years ago, but it gets repetitive quickly, except for Ghibli's productions.I never saw Firefly, I could only get the movie, Serenity, which I enjoyed. About the Neverending Story... I'm such a shame hehe I have never watched it.Regarding books, have you read anything within Orson Scott Card's Enderverse? I'm looking forward to Ender's Game movie this year.;Carolyn, On a side note, I noticed that you have Blade Runner on your list and thought worth mentioning that the movie was loosely based on a novel called 'Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep' by Philip K. Dick, who also wrote another book called 'A Scanner Darkly' witch was made into a moderately successful animated movie.;For anime, try Samurai Champloo if you've not seen it. And I'll always love Avatar: The Last Airbender (the cartoon, NOT the awful movie). That was a quality show. ;You should totally watch Doctor Who. You can start with the new stuff (Christopher Eccleston), no need to go back to the very first season if you don't want to. It's really good. ;To me, It always felt a bit incomplete.;I also love Game of Thrones, read all the books (currently written at the time) and then reread them when the HBO show came out (by the way, I'm so happy with this show: it is one of the better, if not the best, adaptations I've seen).I think all of your comments are really well made. The characterization is amazing for me, brought to life because of how Martin writes the narrative. The story is like a game of Risk, where certain ""colors"" or families win some, then lose some, with each consecutive roll of the dice, but they all have the same goal. I, of course, love all of the core characters, but there are many minor characters that I wish Martin would have latched on to and written in as one of the narrative characters because I want to learn so much more about them.;"

The science fiction short story served this purpose for much of the last century, but currently Sci-Fi blockbuster movies have completely lost this purpose and direction.Our working idea is to put out a series of e-books under the general name ""Hard Squared Science Fiction"".   The first volume is complete but release has been delayed by a bazaar roadblock.   The second volume has now been started and has attached some support already.   Each volume is an independent collaboration.The current story ideas are grouped into themes:1.   Human Space exploration -- This my field and I have three stories available for review.   We now have a storyboard we need expanded into a short story:   http://woodwaredesigns.com/EBook/CepheisDragons.2.   Sustainable Earth -- These are stories about people addressing ecological problems.   We currently have a complex story idea based on a series of TED presentations (space need not be mentioned).3.   First Contact -- Stories about what it would mean to humans to contact star people.   We how have three stories in this series, but the next one needs to be written from the point of view of a porpoise.In each case, the idea is to make the stories about character as much as the technical situations they are in.Please let me know if you would like a review copy of any of these story by email (yet more reading.)If you have story ideas the might fit our general theme (solving the porlbmes of the 21st century), please let me know..

Luckily, I have an addictive personality.  ;None of these stories are meaningless if you know the history and culture they came from. Understanding Grimm's in itself ought to be a course. A German history course, maybe?These stories were all told orally in small villages for reasons specific to those villages before they were written down by the Grimm boys. It's fun to learn the histories they came from, but I also like just giving them my own meanings as a sort of exercise in imaginative thinking.  I should add I totally haven't listened to any of the lectures yet and am not sure if we're given more context by the professor. I should go do that.;Maybe he will discuss this in the lectures to come.  ;Karishma, I would love to elaborate, but I'm still looking into it myself.

Often times, the ""heroine"" wins the day by being kind, sweet, but most importantly, beautiful, and that's about it. However, when I read these stories, I have a mindset that they are more like morality tales, almost like Aesop's Fables. No, they don't always have a moral at the end, but I can imagine parents telling their kids these tales to help teach them lessons to ""be good or else.""  That being said, I did enjoy some of them, including ""The Twelve Brothers, Robber Bridegroom, and The Fisherman and his Wife.""

Thanks.;I think the genre ""fairy tale"" contains various sub-genres.   Some of the Grimms' stories are definitely morality tales, in which the good are rewarded (usually after persevering through some trial) and the wicked are punished.   But others belong to the folk hero genre, or maybe the trickster genre, like Tom Thumb, where the hero wins through cleverness and trickery.

At first, the changes are unpredictable, but after she has both sides of the mushroom, she is able to control and fine-tune her size for the later encounters.Very generally, the four settings are human size, small size (with small animals), tiny size (with the caterpillar), and large size. And this made me think of the races in Grimm's fairy tales: humans, dwarves, elves, and giants. If Grimm's folktales draw distinctions between peoples of different sizes with different names, what does it mean when a little girl can move from one size to another freely -- skipping across the borders between the mundane world and the fantastic world, with as little effort as the bite of a mushroom? (Food = knowledge? Mushroom --> pyschedelic, mind expanding, transcending planes of existence?)Any other thoughts on her changing of size, or on this parallel with the Grimm reading?;To answer your question ""Why aren't people more offended?"" all I can do is give you my personal perspective.I see that there are acts of violence and cruelty in Grimm's fairy tales. However, it never crossed my mind for a second that anything that happened within the pages was true. Certainly, if I had been under the impression that Grimm's fairy tales were a true history of actual events, I would be disturbed.The description of events was not very graphic, or visual. I find horror and slasher films to be much more traumatizing, which is why I choose not to watch them.Also, I understand that violent actions may be a symbol for something else. I imagine if a friend told me that they had a dream where they chopped my head off, I would be disturbed at first, but then I would say to myself, ""I don't think my friend  actually wants to chop my head off. I think it is symbolic of something else."" The imagery in folk tales is very dream-like, and should be read as such.That said, I understand how you feel. Often, when I listen to the news, I feel overwhelmed with all the terrible things that are happening in the world. Sometimes, I need to take a break from the news for a while. So I do, for a few days. Then I come back to it. It is more important to me to feel informed than to feel undisturbed, but I still need a break sometimes.I was once told, ""sensitivity  is a strength, too much sensitivity is a weakness.""

Good point.;That Sci-fi, and other genres, can be used as a tool or even a technique of storytelling rather than a class of story in itself.I've always assumed that one of the major reasons for sci-fi/fantasy is that it's easier to deal with really tough issues by putting them into alternate realities, allowing us to explore the morality and ethics of situations and ways of being by dissociating them from the baggage they have in our world. SFF novels, series, films and comics have always held up a distorting mirror that weirdly provides a sharper, clearer image of our own behaviours. X-Men made huge points about how society treats minorities (and the fact that none of us actually fit all that neatly into the category of ""normal""); Sandman explored sex and gender identities and orientations explicitly, amongst many, many other issues; Watchmen showed up the awful logical outcomes of a world in which there really are superheroes; Star Trek routinely explored morality from the perspective of a society that had had to crawl back from nuclear holocaust and build an egalitarian, co-operative Utopia just to survive...  A friendly acquaintance and I got into a heated discussion about whether the technology in sci-fi should drive or serve the story. I'm a character-driven story fan (""The ship needs to be real because it's a backdrop for the people's stories!""); for him, the characters were secondary to descriptions of tech (""I don't care about the people - I want to know about the mechanics of the ship!""), and what it could do and how. In the end, he conceded that there needs to be a story to tell, or it'd just be a technical manual; I conceded that there was a whole chunk of geekdom that isn't fussed about characterisation, and that this was just fine.;Sometimes I think the difference (often blurred) between science fiction and fantasy is mainly in the need to explain the mechanisms; the how and the why rather than the consequences. For example, in fantasy we might accept dragons, elves or even FTL drives in a plot without needing to know their design principles; wheras in SF (excuse the abbrieve) we might want to understand how they were bred, evolved or researched. I see Star Wars as mostly fantasy with bits of SF but I think this too changed over the series. The 'force' was originally magic(al), but then became a heritable and selectable trait fuelled by mitochondrial-like organelles (!). In Dr Who (the early years) we had many 'what-if' fantasy stories where the science was an almost incidental and unknowable plot device; but that has increasingly given way to engineering and bio-engineering explanations of the fantasy 'tools' and players. Whereas older (pre-information-culture?) stories seemed to accept that special powers just happened or were given/awarded; nowadays SF (or at least a subset of it) requires a plausible scentific explanation ('origin-stories'?) before we can engage with the plot. Perhaps because we are generally more technologically knowledgable today as a society and we don't simply accept that things are unfathomable and we expect to know how they work?  Does this relate to the thread title? I think so - because we are generally much less easily awed. Given our exposure to so much media every day, much of which is scientific and a lot of which is itself pretty awesome (genomics, nanotech, LHC, robotics, synthetic biology); it takes quite a lot to surprise us. However, given the massive increase in publications and other SF/fantasy products now available compared to previous decades, the cumulative awe is probably greater now than it ever has been :) ;I think Carlos just simplified the debate and put a valid point forward. I fear we were diverging into the ""Let's define what Sci-fi is"" category.The more knowledgeable a reader is, the more detailed explanations must be in order for disbelief to be suspended. This causes writers to try more and more to put in detailed explanations, which in turn causes two things:1. The idea (or tech, or concept, whatever) that needed an explanation becomes less exaggerated and/or grand than first intended, as the writer struggles for internal consistency.2. The inherent 'wonder' that comes with the lack of a complete explanation is somewhat er... deflated.I mean, think about it. You're watching a magician perform, and you've already read the how-to manual. How 'awesome' would you feel the performance was? Even if the theatricality, the lighting etc was spot on, the fact that you already know how he does the damn thing makes it a little less impressive, even if it makes you feel a little more clever than the rest of the crowd.So the awesome isn't gone, but as Matthew so aptly said yesterday, ""Sci-fi could do with a little more fantasy once again.""I'm not suggesting we revert to soft sci-fi as in the 50s, (as it would cause a much shorter suspension of disbelief in today's time) but rather that a balance be found somewhere between. Give details to make the whole thing more believable, but let the wizard do it a couple of times.Call it taking a tricky stance, but why do I feel like I'm trying to talk between Kirk and Spock?;I love these.

The West Egg calculator estimates that $2400 in 1812 dollars would had the purchasing power of $31,919 in 2012 dollars.;That would be 626.75 cubic inches of volume, and the density of gold is 10.18 troy ounces per cubic inch.

The presence of Sci-Fi all around makes Sci-Fi itself become more derivative of ... itself.;That's a very good point, the cart has been put before the horse, as it were.;I would agree that this is dipping dangerously close to Hard v. Soft Sci-Fi. I find it interesting that Gar noted Sci-Fi taking technology of today or soon-to-be today, and explore ramifications. It seems to me that the pivotal difference between today's Sci-Fi and that of yester-year (1950's) was that they used to employ the method of finding a new and interesting problem, and imagining the kind of technology that might solve that problem. The Science part of the Fiction seemed much more imaginative because of the abundance of problems yet to be solved.;I would argue that there's a strong difference between fictionalizing fantasy science, and actually creating new science. The explanations some people want would be found much more at home within the pages of a scientific journal. They want every question answered with solid realities, which takes a story right out of Fiction altogether.For magic, the person who comes to mind is Penn Jillette. He mostly does know how magic works (and a whole lot of other things), yet still enjoys watching somebody perform. He enjoys it because if it's done well enough, it can bring back his disbelief (in Magic, disbelief is a good thing) for a moment.It seems to me that it's okay to give as vague an explanation as to say that the method used to communicate instantly across the globe involves wires, or relays or something (clearly with a nod to the 50's). I think Sci-Fi absolutely could do with a little more fantasy, and a little less attempt at being Science itself. Sci-Fi is there to come up with the ideas, not the actual working technologies.;I, for one, am deterred by a book if the bulk of a sci-fi novel is filled with detailed descriptions of the technology. Tell me what I need to know to understand why it's important to the story - but more than that is just showing off.Yes, the author should have thought about it. In depth. That's part of the writer's job.  But - there are several authors I no longer read because, although their stories are interesting, they seem to be too invested in making sure the reader knows ""I did my research."" It bogs down a story for me....;In my view, the narrative, plot, characters and world-building is the entirety of a story. In Sci-Fi, the fictional (though often plausible) science is a part of each of those. The Narrative has to be done well enough that it isn't bogged down with too much information, but that it does adequately explain what's going on and tells its story. The Plot has to necessitate the technologies, or they become nothing but a gimmick for show. The Characters have a certain set of knowledge, which is sometimes expansive (Star Trek) and sometimes they know next to nothing (Philip K. Dick's writings usually); either way, they have to be able to express themselves through the story, and not be relegated to names and faces attached to a technical manual. The World-building seems most important of all; if you were to read a book like Snow Crash and the world-building was not done well enough, you would have nothing to visualize and might not understand the reasons for the technologies they are using. World-Building, in my view, is what happens when the other factors are done perfectly.;Well in six soldiers of fortune none of the men were of a particularly high social class, yet the leader was still lucky in the sense that he found comrades to help him and they were able to trick the king and become rich, but then again none of them were ""heros"" so maybe I'm wrong. Anyways, I think your thesis is insightful and I'm going to re-read all of the Tales and make sure I pay attention to the social hierarchy.;mmm... I think it could be a reflect of that era. I mean, fairy tales work as mirrows of the social status of women and men on those years.;Praduymn, hahah, your comment made me laugh, I like how you twisted the sense.  And I totally agree with you on the theatricality bit. The exact salary is of little importance, I believe. What matters is the descendent (Or is it descendant? sorry there) value of his possesions.  ;This is great! I was wondering why the frog didn't splat against the wall when it was thrown by the princess ...(using my high school physics f=ma  -- I was pretty sure that a frog wouldn't survive).;What happens to f=ma (force equals mass times  accelleration)  when the mass suddenly increases from a one-pound frog to a 150-pound prince?   If we hold the force constant, there's a rapid decelleration and he floats harmlessly to the ground. But if we hold the accellertion constant, there's a  150-fold increase in force and he probably does get splattered.;According to Wikipedia, the European common frog, rana temporaria, weighs 22.7g (0.8 ounces) on average, so I was overestimating by quite a bit. Let's imagine our prince to be five-foot-ten--tall for his time but not freakishly so--and of an ideal weight to be considered handsome and athletic. There are several models in use to determine ideal weight:The J.D. Robinson formula (52 kg + 1.9 kg per inch over 5 feet)  yields an  ideal weight of  156.5 lbsThe D.R. Miller formula (56.2 kg + 1.41 kg per inch over 5 feet)  yields an  ideal weight of  155.0 lbsThe B.J. Devine  formula (50.0kg + 2.3 kg per inch over 5 feet)  yields an  ideal weight of  160.9  lbsThe G.J. Hamwi formula (48.0 kg + 2.7 kg per inch over 5 feet) yields an ideal weight of  165.3 lbsI don't know which is best, so I will take an average: 159.4 lbs.  So turning from frog to prince has increased his mass by 3188 times. Let's just say he's about 3200 times more massive than before.How fast can a princess throw a frog weighing eight tenths of an ounce? I don't know, but women's fast-pitch softball throws can be clocked at up to 75 miles per hour. Granted, the princess is not a trained athlete, and a frog is not very aerodynamic, but the frog would weigh considerably less than a 6.25- to 7-ounce softball. Personally, I'd allow her a 25 to 30 mph frog-pitch.Splat!;I'd wager that the odds aren't actually in favor of my statement.

Time for some research.;""That technique means that every time you're rooting for one of your  favorite characters, you're probably rooting against another one you  love.""Well said.It makes it all the more dramatic AND realistic. In that way, its like watching your best friend and cousin fight each other... Been there.The fact that it makes you root for people on opposing sides of the line only enhances the grey on grey morality of the series. No good or evil people, or sides. Just (violently) different perspectives.;"" 'hard-built' (does this expression exist?)""   It does now. :PI completely agree with that point about loving and hating the same character! I've always hated narratives that force you to try and sympathize with flat characters designated as the good guys. Martin and others like him are a breath of fresh air.Also, it hit me that not only does it create a more dramatic scenario, it also forces you to confront and debate with your own values and sense of morality...

Although I think I shall need to leave Gabriel Oak to his sheep until this course is over....I've not read much sci-fi, I confess. Well, aside from Douglas Adams, of course.  ;I have to disagree just a little. I think that the inclusion of a Faster Than Light technology, or any other as-yet nonexistent technologies pushes a story into what should rightly be called ""Science Fiction,"" and out of ""Fantasy."" I think that the difference comes in when you make the distinction between Technology, and Magic. Technology is something clearly made of human imaginations and ingenuity, whereas Magic is a property of the world around you. In the case of Star Wars, it seems to be predominantly a Fantasy Space-Opera. But I really can't agree that a story is somehow required to have plausible explanations to be called Science Fiction. I also can't agree that the trend of plausible explanations being present is in any way new. Stories from the 1950's and even earlier often had very complex and imaginative technologies, complete with very plausible explanations. The only part that made it matter as far as calling it Science Fiction, was that the stories hinged around those components. If you can remove the hither-to-unknown science from a story and come out with the very same story - it was never Science Fiction.**Personal opinions, and last I checked there is no definitive answer on that.;There's a degree to which you don't have to explain the tech - who writes about someone getting in a car to go somewhere or turning up the thermostat to heat the house and goes into detail? If a world's really well imagined and concrete enough, we have to accept that some people in that world would love nothing more than to spend hours talking about how the technology works, while most would blithely use it without giving it a second thought unless/until it breaks down.I can't recall Ursula Le Guin explaining her ansibles beyond their ability to transmit communications instantaneously across space. But they worked so well as a taken for granted technology that they got lifted by Orson Scott Card and others.My tendency is to see categories as starting points; they soon become too messy and muddled to be really useful. There's more of a Venn diagram going on, or a 3D grid in which the varieties of SFF link up and merge.YMMV... :);Post-apocalyptic and dystopian sci-fi/fantasy was my childhood staple, along with every bit of mythology and fairy tales I could lay my mitts on.

And then the 80s happened: Mad Max, Threads, Terminator, Blake's 7, Z For Zacharia...

Martin first of all presents morality as a subjective idea rather than a strict unwavering code.   His characters move through the world and as they do you see there core values and ideals change.   He also implies that a persons base sense of morality is shaped by many different outside forces such as religion, politics (or house loyalties), ethnicity, and culture.   These same views have never been more substantial than in todays modern world with our ideals of multi-culturalism and global citizenry.   It seems as our wold gets smaller Martin's world, and the realm of epic fantasy itself, is expanding and may eventually become as large a reality itself.;Hello Carol,I have read the entire series to date and I have to say Martin's style of narrative is one of the greatest of it's merits.   The focus on the individual players allows for the reader to not only learn to view Martin's world from the perspective of it's inhabitants, but also to understand the deeper motivations of the players actions.   This combination adds a drama element not traditionally present in fantasy that causes the reader to become more intensely immersed in the story.   I would even go as far as to say that Martin provides a new take on escapism.   ;James I have a theory about the shadowy magic system, which I will not go into detail on because you are not currently up to date with the series and I don't want to ruin it for anyone, that follows the line of thought that the essence of the supernatural elements in this series relates to the final outcome in such a way that to reveal the nature of how and why they occur before certain key events in the story would allow the reader too much insight into the conclusion.   However I would encourage you to read all of the volumes more than once because on my second read through I discovered that several small events, that seemed to be filler at first read, turned out to foreshadow major events (for example an understanding of the Frey's 'king of the crossing game' can mayhaps give insight into predicting their actions and motivations).;I had to check my free kindle store version against the text linked on the course page the translations are very different and some of the titles didn't match at all.   In one story (The Wolf and the Seven Goslings) my version had the main characters as goats instead of geese and I almost missed the connection.

When I saw the reading list for the course I knew I just had to enroll. I want it to be an exercise in self-discipline and to develop my skills as a writer. I want to explore in explicit detail the subject that I am totally passionate about. To have a chance to talk with other people who feel just the same in a non-judgmental and relatively anonymous environment is something completely unusual for me and on the second day of discussions being opened, I've already been sufficiently rewarded in the reading recommendations and insights I've been privy to.

Detectives such as portrayed by Sherlock Holmes use skills of observation and deduction and always get their man. In the real world crimes go unsolved, this may say something about detectives or criminals, I am not sure.But if anything that doesn't happen in the real world is fantasy then is there another genre? What about the great romances. After all we know that being good and nice doesn't mean that we get the girl / boy at the end of the day. Things don't always work out in the end and Lassie doesn't come running in, give a bark, and we follow.  Is all fiction then fantasy?

I think everyone puts a lot of effort into the evaluations. Sometimes, we take an entire four hours to discuss the finished projects of us ten students. Our teacher, I'm sure, takes what we have to say into consideration, but he makes the ultimate decision when it comes to a grade. I know that's not possible with thousands of students, but it seems like there could be a better way to make a class like this work.From a grading standpoint, I worry about how to grade a 16 year old who is still learning what a thesis is and then turnaround and grade a 75 year old retired professor, whose written six academic books in his life. Furthermore, with all of the speakers who have English as their second, third, or fourth languages, I worry that I might not be able to distinguish a sophisticated idea because I'm distracted by the spelling or grammar or what have you. I feel that I could learn a lot from my peers through comments and I feel that I could help others out, but I'm not sure it is a just system where strangers of a variety of ages and academic levels and skills decide, points wise, whether another student passes or fails.Also, I just wanted to make a point about those who post Anonymously.

It's true that in the past technology was limited and even simple things like cell phones and even in some cases computers seemed liked it was truly out there. Science or better the honest pursuit of truth is limited by reality, But science fiction is the imagination of science and it is only limited by the authors imagination. I think that the more truth we discover the more room we make for some truly imaginative science fiction.   Science fiction grows with true science. As science finds what once was thought to be fiction as truth , the science fiction authors are pushed and challenged to keep things moving forward.The awesomeness of it is found in the potential for some science fiction to become science non-fiction.That my view on it all ;I think one of Sci-Fi's obstacles nowadays is that readers are very science savvy; enough not to be impressed by technobabble.

The problem I ran into was that either they didn't have the book I was looking for, or they had multiple versions and I couldn't tell which one I needed. And you're right -- it would get pretty expensive. However, I have a terrible audio book habit already, and part of me doesn't mind feeding it with classics for a class. The trick is making sure that I'm getting the same electronic copy as the audio copy I'm listening too, so I can look up quotes and references later. Audio books are much easier on my eyes, but more difficult for me to take notes with. And no page numbers, of course. :D;Similarly, I would call ""The Handmaiden's Tale"" a dystopian SF, but ""The Fifth Sacred Thing"" by Starhawk is dystopian fantasy, even though Starhawk tries to build on the world of Handmaiden's Tale.Thinking about it, though it was clunky in places, the thing that really delighted me about The Fifth Sacred Thing was the tension between the imperfect yet Utopia-seeking community of the north which focuses on co-operation, equality, and non-violence, and the Dystopian, rigidly stratified theocracy in the south - and the fact that it was through non-violent means that the southern forces were either repelled or persuaded to defect. It's really rare to have creative non-violent protagonists win the day.  Though Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale is set in the aftermath of the so-called ""terrorist attack"" which involved some kind of biological weaponry, it's always struck me as more along the speculative fiction-fantasy area of the spectrum than sci-fi, as there's no real discussion of that or other technology.

That was an interesting time indeed, when early advancements in science still intermingled with many of the old-world views of magic, the occult, etc. Romanticism was on the rise (which sought to critique both the Industrial Revolution and the Age of Enlightenment). One might think of it as an in-between period, a phase connecting the supernatural/alchemical/magical paradigm that came before with the technological/scientific/materialist paradigm that we are in now. Perhaps because so many things were in flux and transition, this is why it is difficult to define the genre of Frankenstein with such hard and fast rules? Gothic Horror might be one category. Fantasy (of the Romantic period) might be another. Science Fiction might be another. Perhaps they are all correct?  ;wow you guys good thoughts, Just a thought how many of our good fantasy/science fiction authors were under the influence like Edgar Allen Poe, who drank?   Ancient ancestors came up with fantastical creatures under the influence of 'shrooms,   when did man start adding in depth references to sex, to their oral/morality stories?   When did others start seeing these subliminal ideas?;Greg, I love your read of Six Soldiers. That made me laugh in my morning oatmeal. And funny as it is, it is a viable reading....;The expectation is that you'd read all of them for the course. Other translations/editions have many more (or different) stories; the Crane edition is the particular set of stories we're focusing on. Happy reading!;Nice answer. I learned something from that. Thanks!;I agree with you, William, and thanks for writing it. I couldn't seem to get the words out in a way that made sense. I shouldn't post at bed time.The question of fairy tale vs myth has been sloshing around in my brain. There is a clear difference. I was going to mention American Gods but decided that was more myth.... Disney hits up the fairy tales, more often... I'll have to look into if there is much adult-oriented fairy tale re-writing.  Anyone seen Grimm (isn't that what the TV series is called?). I haven't, but it seems that based on the name that would be worth a watch. We'll see.;Magical Realism, as I understand the term, is more subtle than urban fantasy. This is my personal interpretation, anyway. Magical Realism is where ""impossible"" things happen but no one blinks an eye - or just accepts that this is expect-able (yes, I just made up that word). ""The House of the Spirits"" by Isabel Allende would be an example - as, I think, much of the writing by Haruki Murakami (""Kafka on the Shore"" and ""The Wind-up Bird Chronicles,"" for example). These don't quite fall into the realm of fantasy (though maybe someone could make the case for Murakami edging toward fantasy... I don't think so...) but clearly they aren't ""real."" Special people see or talk to spirits, or know things, or talk to cats, or make journeys into pockets of other-worldliness, but they mostly live in the world as we know it. They just have some special rules that the rest of us don't necessarily experience.I haven't read much urban fantasy (I am thinking Neverwhere, American Gods (?), and something set in the Seattle Underground but I can't remember for the life of me the book... something about a devil.....), but my thought is it's basically gritty fantasy set in a ""hidden"" part of a city... kind of Alice-in-Wonderland like? Gotta take a trip through a rabbit hole to get there?But that's just conjecture.....;I wonder if a ""fairy tale"" by definition is a tale that has centuries of telling behind it? I'll have to chew on that. I don't know that there is a hard and fast definition of fairy tale, actually. I just did a quick search and found a wide variety of descriptions of what a fairy tale is.... how would you define it?That said, there is a large body of work out there using fairy tales (or myth....) fast-forwarded into modern times.  ;I was just doing some reading about the history of these tales, and found that even the Grimm brothers changed/sanitized/adjusted the tales for a variety of purposes. They published multiple editions in their life time, with a wide variety of religious adaptions, for example.... so it's not just translations but initial editions, too. I think the tales themselves are not a reliable record of what was actually passed from generation to generation.Interesting:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimms'_Fairy_Tales;Interesting comment, Shaun. I've been thinking about the tales and how they reflect a peoples' thoughts on authority (maybe specifically royalty?) - and it made me think of red shoes, in general. Once, kings wore red heels (yes... HEELS!). So one could read Grethel's red heels and her subsequent ""great airs"" as a royal reference.  I've been tossing around this idea in re: the essay that's pending, and your comment helped me make some connections. Thanks!;I find myself increasingly interested in references to royalty, specifically stories that indicate an uneasiness with/distrust of royalty.  Six Soldiers of Fortune clearly has a king's untrustworthiness as a core element of the story. Clever Grethel has red heels, which makes me wonder if she's a stand-in for royalty (and she certainly steals and covers her theft through trickery); also, the red silk in The Death of the Red Hen may be relevant. These are just a few allusions and I haven't finished thinking about this.Of course not all tales involving kings or royalty qualify... but some seem to lean that direction.Anyway, any thoughts on this? If many of these stories are rooted in the experiences of the ""common man,"" then it seems that some tales would reflect an ambivalence toward those in power.;I wonder if the idea of ""common royalty"" is as oxymoronic as you think... once upon a time, kingdoms were small and plentiful... so the idea that there would be multiple realms (and multiple kings) close to one another isn't all that far-fetched...;The idea of royalty as a parallel to modern celebrity is intriguing...  ;The way women live within these tales is a huge part of why I dislike them so intensely. I understand historical importance, a part of the times, etc...but that doesn't mean that I have to like it. I'm thinking hard, but is there ever a ""warrior woman"" in here? Even the best of the women in these stories are at the mercy of men.  Not all ""classic"" folklore has women wordlessly agreeing to marriage simply because they were asked.....;The Raven is a good example, though this story, too, has a girl wordlessly marrying a king because he likes her looks...I think originally these tales were told by men and women. Yet they were collected by men, and subsequently rewritten by men.... so I would consider that they are heavily influenced by a male perspective.(I am in no way male-bashing, by the way...);Excellent resource. Enjoyed the reading immensely, and would love to read this collection! Would be interesting to compare/contrast with Grimm...;I think you're right on the money, Ann. I have been thinking about similar things (of course I start really getting my brain in gear AFTER I've written my little essay......). The idea that a woman's ""power"" - her ability to fix a problem (ie, brothers who are geese....) lies in her willingness to shut up, stick herself in a tree, and sew shirts of flowers... well, that is much different than going on a quest to find a golden apple.;I think that's a solid essay idea. These essays have a very small scope (holy cow they're short!), and this seems like a nice, confined-yet-interesting topic. Enjoy writing!;Interesting thread. Thanks.  So I'm in on the line of thought that the queen of hearts represents ""society"" at large - unpredictable, arbitrary rules that change on what seems to be a whim, crazy consequences always threatened but not really executed (excuse the pun...)...I especially like the comment of being ""too big for some things, too small for others."" I remember struggling like that as a kid, too.  ;I thought about that, too. I'm enjoying the video lectures a lot - and would have enjoyed the perspective. That said, I bet if we'd seen them before we would have read many essays that were variations on the videos' themes..... and, speaking for me, anyway, it could have made coming up with a thesis more difficult because I would have been afraid of ""copying"" the lecture....A tricky balance!;I just checked - they're still there!  ;So this was brought up in another thread, but it's interesting in its own right - so I wanted to give it its own thread....Identity. As I read through these two stories, I was struck at the concept of identity. Alice's identity is in flux through these stories. She forgets who she is (in the woods...), she is easily convinced that she doesn't exist (such a mean trick,Tweedledee and Tweedledum!)... She forgets the words to poems she knows and struggles to explain who she is....I'm interested in others' thoughts (as well as examples that I've failed to write here... bedtime!).....;I guess I hadn't thought about it much before; I'm not really an Alice aficionado. Thanks for the heads-up on that... I'll check out some materials!  ;In chapter 5 of Through the Looking Glass, Alice tells the Queen: ""I'm seven and a half, exactly."";I found them hard to score, too - even though I've graded hundreds of essays in the past. Only one of the five essays I read really ""wowed"" me, and I was very disappointed with general form. It was very hard to follow the logic of most of the essays, and I read them multiple times to give them the benefit of the doubt. I felt like a scrooge in scoring, but if it simply isn't understandable...... I'm curious to see what my scores are, now that I've seen others' essays.....I think people are struggling with the concept of a single, contained thesis. People are biting off too much topic and struggling to do anything with it....;I think you have a great point, Florencia - it's important to separate form from content. While that can be difficult to do when form interferes with meaning, it's worth working through....;"

When facing adversities or challenges he manages to surpass them, which leads him to he make a name for himself and end up as king.He is both lucky and witty, and although the title says ""gallant"", his actions show how he takes advantage of the situations he sees himself into, and how his luck and wits make him see himself as gallant and how other people see himself as such, even though he is presented to the reader under a different light.;Thanks for your comment!I have this bad habit of scratching the surface and leaving...

I'm guessing that video will answer the questions.;London, UK, added! :);I think it's very interesting how these folkloric and therefore, communal, products can turn into individual pleasures. The effect of a fairy tale is personal, but the tradition is passed through the years by all of us. And in that sense, it's plural as well.  ;I think crouched in a lot of fairy tales are guides or values that are important or believed by a certain society.   Many are morality tales that are meant to impart some knowledge or wisdom about human interactions, fears, and/or dreams.;Fairy tales have familiar and fairly rigid structures, and humans like recognizable patterns.   Think of the patterns of three: if a story has three sons, you know the first two are going to make the same mistake, and the third one will figure out how to avoid it.   That's a pattern as regular and familiar as the knock-knock joke.   And there's some evidence that pattern recognition is tied to the release of dopamine in the brain, which is what makes old familiar things so pleasurable.Of course, subverting a familiar pattern by adding *unexpected* rewards gives an even greater rush of dopamine.   I imagine this is why retellings of fairy tales are so popular at the moment. :);Hi Larissa, do you know of any online versions that have that introduction?Thanks;And yet, so many of the Tales seem surreal, a string of bizarre incidents laid out with little in the way of pattern, just as they were told to the Grimms. There is something primal about them rather than patterned after social mores, something of them that screams, ""We are not to be read in the context of THIS world but another. Throw away your logic and the safety of what you know. This is about a world in which adhering to social norms does you no good - this is the Otherworld, in which the rules are very different."";Cheri, I too, was so glad they were over. I felt much as I did as a freshman in college having to read Hemingway's Nick Adams Stories - Oh God, another story about fish; I'm going to hurl this book against the wall!I read the first part of the tales at a more leisurely rate, but the last half in a couple of days. I found myself rolling my eyes and thinking, another evil step mother, another person doing what I consider the wrong thing and getting away with it, etc. etc. I echo your questions:  ""what is it about these tales that has made them so important? To what human experience do they speak?""

So people keep saying (not necessarily on this post, but in the world at large...) that these are stories to teach morality. What!?! Tom Thumb... in both of the Crane stories, Tom Thumb dupes people - he's a liar! - and ends up just fine in the end. Others suffer significant losses (and they aren't always bad people, either... Tom Thumb just doesn't care. He's chaos in a miniature....).  And in The Little Farmer, well... that rascal becomes king in the end - by thievery, trickery, and murder (if you count convincing others to roll themselves into the river inside hole-riddled barrels as murder......)! How is that morality? Maybe the moral is that stupid people deserve to lose their fortunes (and their lives), even if their ends are brought about through deceit....I could continue my rant - if you're pretty you win, if you're ugly you're evil, dad's are utterly useless (they never seem to stand up to stepmothers...)...Maybe they speak to the darkness of life in the time of these stories' creation? Are they lessons that success does not necessarily go to the good, merely the more clever?  Anahita: I could see a childhood memory of these stories being told by a person (especially a family elder!) making them nostalgic and wonderful. That's how these stories were once passed down. Anything told within the human context of a storyteller would be richer. I guess for me, the text version is just... blah. My guess is that in Real Life, these stories were altered by the teller to teach some particular moral or illustrate some sort of point...

But the sacredness of the number 3 or the literaty tool of repetition must be much older than the bible and does not stem from this.  ;I think that it might also have the very simple function of making the story slightly longer. If the story was about a person that went into the world, met an obstacle, conquered it and returned home, there would not be much entertainment. By having three (or more) obstacles, or sometimes three sons/daughters where the first two fail the first obstacle and the third makes it by overcoming three obstacles, we have a story that is of a useful length; short enough to be told at bedtime or over a jug of beer, but not so long as to bore the audience or make the storyteller get confused (indeed, it is also easier to remember a story when you have three similar points along the storyline).  This is of course not the only or entire explanation, but it might be part of why there are three obstacles in many fairy tales.;A major difference between Andersen's stories and Grimm's is the degree of details. As Andersen's stories are his own - inspired by the tradition of fairy tales of course, but created by his fantasy - you will find that they in much greater detail describes the looks and feels of the items in the stories. He takes great care to arrange the setting, whereas the fairy tales can take place almost anywhere in the world.Take as an example the introduction to Aschenputtel:""There was once a rich man whose wife lay sick, and when she felt her end drawing near she called to her only daughter to come near her bed, and said,  ""Dear child, be pious and good, and God will always take care of you, and I will look down upon you from heaven, and will be with you.""  And then she closed her eyes and expired. The maiden went every day to her mother's grave and wept, and was always pious and good. When the winter came the snow covered the grave with a white covering, and when the sun came in the early spring and melted it away, the man took to himself another wife.""And the introduction to The Little Match Girl:""It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark. Evening came on, the last evening of the year. In the cold and gloom a poor little girl, bareheaded and barefoot, was walking through the streets. Of course when she had left her house she'd had slippers on, but what good had they been? They were very big slippers, way too big for her, for they belonged to her mother. The little girl had lost them running across the road, where two carriages had rattled by terribly fast. One slipper she'd not been able to find again, and a boy had run off with the other, saying he could use it very well as a cradle some day when he had children of his own. And so the little girl walked on her naked feet, which were quite red and blue with the cold. In an old apron she carried several packages of matches, and she held a box of them in her hand. No one had bought any from her all day long, and no one had given her a cent.""The details are so much more important in Andersen's stories, as they are his exact words and probably written and re-written many times until *he* was content, while the details - save from a few magic phrases or adjectives that are important for the story later on - are not that important in fairy tales and have probably been changed a million times over the years, with all the different storytellers, until the brothers Grimm wrote them down - and they don't seem to have been all to careful with the wording, as long as the point was made.  One other issue here - for I need to get back to my essay and not spend my Monday evening writing about Andersen - is the unimportant details, Andersen brings into the story. E.g. ""One slipper she'd not been able to find again, and a boy had run off with the other, saying he could use it very well as a cradle some day when he had children of his own."" - this comment from the boy is in no way important, we have already learned that the slippers were big, event way too big, and also that they had been her mother's. But Andersen wants us to really feel with this girl, so he overloads us with details about the mocking. Fairy tales rarely contain anything that is not important to the storyline.;Sorry, forgot to add:  Aschenputtel is quoted from the Lucy Crane edition, The Little Match Girl quotation is Hersholt's translation, which is a very good translation (http://www.andersen.sdu.dk/vaerk/hersholt/TheLittleMatchGirl_e.html).;I grew up with these fairy tales and it was nice to meet some of the characters again - Mother Hulda, oh I had completely forgotten about her, and I recalled the images of my childhood fairy tale books. Note to self: Must find these books at my mother's house and have my own kids read them :)As for the two-dimensional characters, I think that it is very important in folk tales and fairy tales to have basic characters with basic stereotypical features - greedy, proud, wise, dumb, beautiful - as it makes it so easy to transfer the stories from one part of the world to another. These stories are quite universal and have been around ""forever"", which might have been difficult if the characters were complex. Also, it makes it easier for the storyteller to tell almost the same story each time as he does not have to dwell on or remember details about the characters, places, etc. - just the basic outline of the story. Something happened to someone, he did this, this happened, he did that, then this happened and he won. It also makes the stories perfect to tell over supper, before putting the kids to bed, between songs around the fire in the evening etc.;It is always an hour after the submission deadline, just as we get the results an hour after the peer review submission deadline - so in a few minutes :);On the Home screen to the right there is an Upcoming Deadlines section with the Assignment link.

These tales were around for a long time, as folktales, as warning tales, etc. The Grimms were simply the ones who wrote them down in a collection to be published and studied many years later. A.S. Byatt, in the introduction to my version points out that ""the Grimms' narrative style moves from the impersonal oral to the 'authored' story with psychology."" Meaning, they started just writing down the tales that were told to them, but at some point, they began to change little details of the story for better flow and other reasons. Like myths, there were also often many different versions of the tales, too.;As for the title of the post, I don't think it has. Science Fiction is every bit as awesome as it's ever been - but we progress in actual science so quickly that it's hit a sort of literary uncanny valley. In the 1950's, the projections of future technology had a lot more wiggle room than they do now, since we have the technology (and even better, often) nearly as soon as the story's been read.Also, in the 1950's-1960's and some of the 1970's, we had a very strong Space program, and inherently more reason to look forward. I feel like we need to be actually exploring new territory in order to do it in our fantasy. ;I certainly see what you mean about the uncanny valley.  I sketch a lot, and most of my drawings include mythical and fantasy characters and creatures. Consequently, I end up looking up and studying other people's work for the sake of self-improvement. I find that if I ever do too much of this research in one day (more than 20 concepts), my own imagination freezes up, rendering me unable to draw anything new, anything I hadn't already seen before.  There is an infinite number of ways a green dragon can be drawn, but few differences in those green dragons.  Perhaps, because sci-fi is now all around us, we (both creators and consumers of sci-fi) have hit the same sort of saturation point? It hasn't necessarily lost its awesome, but rather hit a point where all new ideas seem pretty much the same.  I hope I haven't gone off topic or misunderstood your point, Casey.  ;WOW! I love your post. It really got me thinking. Your right once you have been so saturated with a topic it is hard to come up with anything new. I'm a young adult science fiction writer and coming up with some completely new is very hard because so much has been done already. Sometime it feels like I'm just rewriting the something in different words. That's when I have to stop and make an adjustment to what I'm doing.; So the artform became science in a fiction setting instead of fictional science  Wow, that is an excellent observation! But I wonder where the line is drawn (or if it can be drawn) between these two? A little bit of science in fiction can help to suspend your disbelief and drawn you into the world a bit more, but fictional science can be more fun and escapist. I'd hate for a book to be a slave to either end of the spectrum, but I do like a little bit of science fact in my SF and, done right, I don't think it gets in the way of the fun and escapism. One technique I enjoy in SF books is taking the technology of today (or maybe a few years from now) and exploring the ramifications of it. For example, Halting State by Charles Stross looks at online roleplaying games a few years from now and how they are being used by criminals. The technology in that book feels like it could exist within the next five years and supports the plot without getting in the way. ;The awesome of this topic is filling me with nerd fire. I'm not entirely sure how to quote other posters on this forum so I'll try my best to not mangle too badly. Firstly, Casey you're right. Sci-fi has become a derivative of itself, but only because it's the natural evolution of a genre that has been around as long as it has. And the spawning of sub-genres is what iteratively brings us back to the Hard v. Soft Sci-fi as Pradyumn observed.  But I think what Gar said points to an even more astounding possibility, one I've thought of exploring for a while now. That Sci-fi, and other genres, can be used as a tool or even a technique of storytelling rather than a class of story in itself.  ;Theo, I'd wager you're better versed than I am in Sci-fi lore at this point, as I have yet to make the acquaintance of the good Doctor. I've just had a little more time to distil my thoughts on the matter. But I concur that using theoretical science as a means to explain fantastical elements is simply the next progression in the evolution of Sci-fi. Just taking the Grimm Bro's stories and thinking how the Dr. would explain talking animals, would bring in whole new elements of fantasy and Sci-fi as a duo instead of opposing forces.;I am with you Casey. I also disagree that in the more to learn section just tossed all comic books aside. All comic books are not super heroes. Even novels such as Ender's Game ( one of my favorite novels of all time) has been adapted into comic book form. Popular SF franchises such as Star Trek and Star Wars have ongoing comics.... And I would definitely would argue comics such as Swamp Thing, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (that's right, they were comic books before they were movies) may beg to differ, but that's just me and my opinion. ;My belief about science fiction is that we have evolved from stories about the glorious, technologically advanced future, to what happens when all that goes wrong. My new favorite books and stories are dystopian novels, such as Brave New World, and that have had new young life breathed into them, thanks to the success of series like The Hunger Games. There is a plethora of dystopian series out there now, such as my favorite, Divergent by Veronica Roth, and others, such as Delirium by Lauren Oliver, Partials by Dan Wells,   The Maze Runner by James Dashner, and Across the Universe by Beth Revis (which is more of a pure sci-fi leaning than the others). I don't think sci-fi has ""lost its awesome""; I just think it has evolved and changed over time.  ;Possimpable! Love it! lolBut are dreams not fantasy's in themselves ...;SF as a whole is some sort of fantasy on its own, but I meant dreams more as a metaphor for ""humanity wishing for this or that"", not precisely dreaming while sleeping. Gibson ""dreamt"" of the cyberspace and built it up in his Sprawl Trilogy as well as his distopian corporate-controlled society where slums are the places where more ""freedom"" is possible.Humanity ""dreamt"" of traveling to the Moon as well as through time. Those dreams have fueled SF and as Casey stated: we need more problems to be fixed and IMHO the fast-progress technology and science that exist nowadays should create some kind of a new ""era"" or at least ""trends"" in the SF genre.What are your thoughts?;Maybe I am a little bit off topic with this but anyway... Have you read Argentinian or Latinoamerican sf? Because there you'll find a lot of awesomeness that it's missing in Anglo sf. Of course, there's not much techno-awesomeness in it but there a lot of focus in what could be called social, anthropological or metaphysical science fiction, plus a lot of humor and ""uncorrectness"" (in form and in language).If you are interested (and can read in Spanish, of course), I recommend you to go to Axxon, the greatest and oldest sf magazine of Argentina (24 years old and it was always digital, it was first distributed in floppy disks and then online). The url is axxon.com.ar.Also check Cuasar  (also long lived, 25 years old), Pr _xima and La Idea Fija (which is not strictly a sf magazine but it is sf friendly);I am Mexican and have been struggling to find latinamerican SF.

One can marvel at explained things as well as unexplained ones... if its done well enough.

Point well made, and taken.And Cheri just simplified what I was trying to say. Thanks.Going back to Casey's point, the part ""if done well enough"" is what's bugging me.

Also, back then, children did not live such protected lives. Most of them have seen several siblings die, even in wealthy families.;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_RomanticismHere is a short link to German romanticism. The Grimm Brothers were mainly linguists, they wrote an enormous handbook of the German language (how the meaning of words changed over time) that is still in use. The folktale collections were just a side project for them - but mediawise they were very advanced. for example they did not really travel that much from place to place to collect these tales, but they put adds in the newspapers and asked people to submit them or to meet them so they could take notes. Many of the tales are also variations of even earlier French tales. All of that happened around the time of the French Revolution - and I think partially these stories and their effort to conserve the German language has to do with the turmoil all around them. They wanted to create a German ""nation"", with one language and a folktale tradition of their own   (which did not really exist back then, there were just many different districts and small states, only loosely connected through a language).;   It's not about ""a"" moral, I think.

As someone who also enjoys both the writing and reading of fantasy this course was a simple choice. Still must admit I am a bit nervous though! -Jim ;Greetings to all of you! It's a great pleasure (if not a bit daunting) to see the first posts which such insightful comments.  There also is something quite deep about the idea of, how Theodossi put it, what is real. For that power is something authors exploit to an amazing degree. With simple words on a page they transport us to a different world one perceived by the author and existing in their mind. They create what is real for the reader and we are along for the ride.  Best of luck to us all! -Jim ;I'm Jim McCarthy from Chicago. Very anxious to get this ball rolling! Best of luck! ;Hello Carol, I've also read this series (haven't read the fifth one yet no spoilers!) and must agree the authors use of different driving voices for each chapter offers unique perspective.   The author also uses a great way of having facts of the story diluted by each characters perspective, for example: (spoilers!) the dragons returning, most characters seem to take it as pure rumor and myth yet he has shown the reader that it is a fact. Using these types of rumors and perspective gives the reader a fantastic way of truly witnessing what each character experiences whether they be right or wrong. Also his use of morality is interesting. Most of the characters may wish for the world to be black and white but as shown with characters like Cersei Lannister and Catleyn Stark who are similar (mothers, daughters of powerful houses, willing to go to extreme lengths to protect their children) yet also have key differences (beauty, honor, a loving marriage) show the great conflict within the world and that it is all grey. Where one woman is shown to be honorable and trust worthy and the other ruthless and cunning yet both are protecting their children by whatever means (maybe the queen wants to retain her position but honestly, who wouldn't?) Jim ;Dominick, First of what an enlightening post. Well thought out and caused me to pause and contemplate my response. Now that my adulations are out of the way the matter at hand. Martins use of the ""family house"" is a great way to equate the pressures of blind loyalty. If someone is born into something they are inevitably shaped by it. Which is why most people find Arya such a compelling character. She seems to forgo all the family ties (she struggles with this but who wouldn't) and goes on her own, albeit bumpy, path. Someone who doesn't want to be shaped by what she was born into but wants to be who she is. In fact, reflecting on the series as a whole he has  an interesting way of writing female characters. Look at the vast differences between Arya and Sansa, or the queen and Catleyn. Dany and Brienne. All of them strong characters in different ways, it's inspiring. (Even frustrating for an aspiring author). Which lends a bit of lesson to the world that these women are powerful and are shaping the world even if they are looked down upon on their sex. A good point for our modern world to pick up on. ;Exactly! That sort of ambiguity concerning morality is especially rare in fantasy settings where there are tons of mindless evils. Indeed, there is a sort of mindless evil in the white walkers but the true driving force is the characters moral compass being completely understandable and even relatable. How does everyone feel on his use of magic? I love and hate it. It's eluded to and kept away from the reader mostly but, when shown, isn't fully understood and the author seems to be keeping the reader in the dark, almost indefinitely, on the inner workings of the magic of westeros. ;Hmm how interesting. I will have to pick the series up again after this course ends. I did notice he used a good bit of foreshadowing during the scene (spoiler) when Dany entered the house of the undying she witnessed one vision in particular of a man with a wolfs head and a crown upon its brow. And we all know what happened to Robb Stark at the red wedding. I may be forced to reread all four entries now. Thanks a ton! ;"

In the tales, these journeys represent the hero's coming of age, and his recruits and items represent the skills developed in his journey towards manhood.While this trope is present in different tales, one key aspect that changes is the degree of awareness the hero has about his development. In  The Queen Bee, the hero is unaware of the troubles he will face, and is only concerned about following his instincts and thrice rejecting to cause suffering to innocent creatures.  The White Snake  presents a similar premise, in which the hero goes a step further; he tries to quench his curiosity by eating the snake, and receives the ability to understand the creatures that suffer. After helping the creatures, he becomes aware that he shall be rewarded.The Knapsack, the Sack and the Horn, present a hero in a later stage of development; he is aware that he needs a set of special skills to overcome his brothers. Through his journey not only does he collect items but learns to use them to the point where he can defend himself when one of his treasures is used against him. The hero's development reaches its maximum in  Six Soldiers of Fortune, where the protagonist is fully aware of the components he needs to amass in over to overcome his final challenge.""Now, I am a made man and it is time to go home again and see how my brothers are faring""[1]. The increase in awareness is a sign of growth; and being aware of his own development, the hero discovers what skills are worth learning and mastering.Here are the comments for FORM (grade: 2)peer 1      The sentences are correct, the words are properly used and the arguments are clear.

(Yes, Hallowe'en!)Danny Boyle directed the play and made the brilliant casting decision to have two strong actors rotate the two lead roles.

I suggest that you trim your essay a bit, paste it in again, and then see whether Coursera accepts it.FYI, I ran a test to identify the word-count differences between MS Word and Coursera, and the difference is exactly explained if Coursera is counting contractions as two words. So if you have any contractions in your essay (I had a few just from the text I quoted from ""Alice""), they're probably putting you over 320 words in Coursera's view.

Fantasy tales in general are extremely rigid when it comes to social structures playing a part in what trials and tribulations a hero (or heroine) faces.  Another point. Its not just luck. Anyone noticed that heroes of low birth have their virtues, skills and values taught to them, while the 'nobler' ones seem to already have a predisposition for them?  And whenever we see that our hero happens to be a very fast learner, (I'm looking at you, Paolini) or has exceptionally strong values and character, surprise! He had noble blood all along, and now it makes perfect sense.  There are exceptions of course, but thats the general trend. I do realise I strayed from your point a little, but this tendency seems to crop up everywhere, not just in the Grimms. It seems our ancestors were very taken with genetics.  Possible causes according to me: 1. During the times the stories came up, Kings and nobles were seen as having a 'divine' right to rule, and were seen as 'superior' in terms of blood. A boy with amazing luck/virtue would be more believable if he were of noble blood. 2. Tales would be passed on to the nobles, who would obviously want to be seen as the good guys.

I would disagree that the simplistic nature of the fairy tell reflects the time period because the idea of proposing on love at first sight is as  preposterous  as it is today, perhaps even more so because economics and alliance play less of a role in marriage.  I recommend Bruno Bettelheim's  The Uses of Enchantment  to anyone interested in a Freudian interpretation of fairy tales. It in part explains the simplistic nature of fairy tales through their connection to children. The children's sense of morality is different than ours and the endings we see as cruel or harsh actually have a sense of justice to them. On the other hand, evil sometimes wins and fairy tales introduce the notion that ""life isn't fair"" in a story that is short and more easily digested.

If it were released a decade later, the female captain thing wouldn't be an issue...or as much as one, I stil meet backwards- thinking individuals who say a female captain is wrong and that hate Janeway because she's a female captain or they the Mulgrew, etc. Sad. ;Disclaimer: I came into Who during the Tennant years, which in some Old Who circles makes anything I say about Who instantly invalid. ;)However, I'm a huge Douglas Adams fan, and one of the things I love about Who is the slight camp nature of it (though, sadly, that seems to be falling by the wayside in the Moffat era of MORE SFX!)... so I immediately went back and devoured everything I could get my hands on, starting with Pirate Planet and then watching in order from the beginning. And I found things to love in every Doctor and almost every script. That experience leads me to believe two things:1. Old Whovians who complain so bitterly about New Who have a fundamentally different view of the show (perhaps colored by nostalgia) than someone who came into New Who and goes back to look at everything in Old Who as objectively as possible.2. New Whovians don't go back and look at Old Who nearly often enough (which probably feeds the animosity between the two groups - as a long time Beatles fan, I know the huge influx of Anthology fans *often* drove me mad with what I saw as stunning ignorance of everything that came before the Anthology, the importance of the Anthology to those of us who had been waiting for it for decades, damn kids get off my lawn, etc. I've been there).If there is any Doctor who fits less into the mold of ""The Doctor"" for *me*, it's Eleven... I find him to be disturbingly morally *ambiguous* (as opposed to ""morally following a different code to humans"") in a way none of the others have quite been. That's not a criticism of Matt Smith as much as the actual writing of Eleven - he's written in a more mercurial, more unpredictable way than any of his predecessors, to my eyes. But plenty of Old Whovians tell me I'm wrong and he reminds them of Troughton - I see what they mean, but I interpret it differently. A chacun son go  t!;Considering that this is a sci-fi and fantasy class, and therefore there are some literature buffs amongst us, I would also recommend: ""The Shakespeare Code"" (Season 3, Episode 2, Tennant). It has a very different flavor to the ones above, more fantastical with a little bit of history (and, of course, a little sci-fi). There's also some great stuff about the power of words.Don't get me wrong, I love all of the episodes above, but all but one were written by Steven Moffat, and there are many other talented writers in the Whoniverse.Edit: Oh, and lovers of steampunk, the episode you want is called ""The Next Doctor."" ;If you have any more specific questions, let me know.

I even read an article once that said the act of gossiping in modern times reinforces what behavior is considered acceptable by the group and what is not (i.e. worth commenting on and meriting disapproval.)

There is a power in  tie breaking, which relates back to their idea of masculinity.

The image of the bride being devoured by her husband seemed reminiscent of the way woman were thought of as property during medieval times. By getting married, you were giving away the right to make your own decisions and your own personhood.The imagery of the peas and lentils having budded overnight also stood out to me as being about lost innocence. Peas bud when fertilized, and the girl lost her innocence by watching them eat the other girl. ;Thanks! I think it probably will be.;I really like your analysis of this!

Even the best of us flaws, and even the worst of humanity has good moments.I think the gender roles are important in that the mouse is the one who had to stay home all day keeping house, and so she missed the chance to ""eat the fat"" or see all the world has to offer. The cat is also dismissive of her contributions and opinions, saying, ""That's because you are always sitting at home in your little grey frock and hairy tail, never seeing the world, and fancying all sorts of things."" In the end, she ends up getting taken advantage of and killed. It is interesting that another story, ""Hans in Luck,"" also seemed a warning against being too trusting.;I agree. Clever Gretel in particular bothered me. Looking at it from a strict morality standpoint, you wonder why she gets away with it all. The purpose of that tale almost seemed to be to teach children not to trust others, and perhaps they would have an easier time of it than if they had to learn the lesson the hard way- through life experience. There's still a part of me that thinks, though, they will learn that the world is not all good, life is not fair, ect. soon enough, why not let them enjoy their childhood innocence a little longer?;I wonder if in some instances it did have religious implications for the  author/reader, especially considering the time period in which it was  written. I noticed in Faithful John, there were three ravens discussing  the three tragedies/tests that would befall the King before he could  marry the beautiful woman. The story reached a turning point for the  better when both Faithful John and the two prince's lives were saved  (three lives!) while the Queen was at her prayers in the church. The authors could have had her be anywhere. I think in this case it was deliberate references, considering the importance the number three has always had to the church. ;Is anyone else here from Oklahoma?;I had read many of these tales as a child, but I was amazed by all the stuff I missed when I was younger!

The surroundings and ways of life changed,  much of the older myths and traditions were forgotten, meaning of some  was lost or transformed. New traditions were created, new details that  concerned current life were added. Each fairy tale developed as a living  organism, changed, aged, gave its offsprings, merged with others. And  writing it down means stopping this development. Printed word could be  only reprinted, misprint is a fault (we can play it at the stage, make a  film etc., but it's quite a different story).""The Raven"" is a good illustration: it contains very archaic elements as well as rather modern. For example, the letter and the maps.  I'm sure they were added lately. But not before the words on the paper became a common thing: in this tale the literate person is a  magician or a sorceress. A land-chart is a miracle! You can find any town you want:  what an amazing thing!(And just a little guess. The giant  mentions a child left in the house. I think it's a snatch of older plot  layer: there might have been three brothers, big, middle and little, but  the original episode was replaced to the one with maps though this  irrelative child stayed.

Each and every one seems to lay out what looks to be a moral, and then either end it in some sort of pointless misery, or end up teaching the exact opposite of the expected moral. I can see the humor in it, and I can see the literary importance - but I just can't get myself to actually enjoy a single one of their writings.;This is all making me wonder about how people in early 19th c. rural Germany conceptualised ""luck"". I know that the concept of individual identity was quite different in some ways, so was ""luck"" more like the modern notion of random chance or the idea of ""luck"" as an inherent quality you carry about with you (which was prevalent in my neck of the woods, and still continues with the idea that a person can be innately ""lucky"").Not very helpful. Just mulling.;I think that luck itself plays an extremely important role in most of the fairy tales. Like, even if luck is not directly mentioned, a person can be lucky by being cunning and intelligent (like in clever Gretel, six soldiers of fortune, and the rabbits bride) Gretel is lucky because she doesn't get caught due to her intelligence, and the six soldiers use their skills to outsmart the king which is complete luck in itself that they all came together. Also the maiden in The Rabbits Bride is lucky that she was able to trick the rabbit and return home. Luck also plays roles in many stories of heroism, and the like.;One of my favorite editions of ""Household Tales"" begins with an introduction by A.S. Byatt and she does a fabulous job of outlining what makes these tales so enduring. That introduction is well worth the read. ;OK;Rebecca, that is really insightful. We tend to lump the Grimm collection together as ""fairy tales"", and because fairy tales have become morality tales, it's hard to get round our expectations of what the Tales were at the time.  ;What I think is interesting is that there's so much scope for acting out these tales, as Anahita mentioned in relation to her grandmother. They're so succinct and spared of detailed description that they make the imagination work really hard and that provides huge artistic licence when it comes to taking it from the book and back to oral tradition where it came from. I think the point about patterns is a good one, especially when we look at the tales from an oral perspective. It's like in the Odyssey where there are set phrases that repeat again and again.  ;As I said, much argument in many directions. I thought it an interesting perspective, in current times as well with LOTR and Song of Fire and Ice (Lewis obviously used symbols from his tradition, yet still honored ancient motifs)...it's nice to know that the old themes still ring true.In terms of Disney, he was speaking mainly of Fantasia, the use of having Mickey as an apprentice to a Sorcerer, he contrasted that with books that had been banned at the time for obvious witchcraft symbolism...;I love that you figured this out.

Were the stories told mostly by women in the house? Were they told to mostly to children? Do you suppose the men in their circles and amongst themselves told different stories? There were a lot of stories with girls in negative roles but also a lot of them had characters in which the girls were very positive. The goose girl, the story of the sister in the 12 brothers, Grehel, there are a lot of situations where there is a humble industrious girl as opposed to a lazy self-centered girl? Do you think these were mostly tales to encourage girls to live such lives? There don   t seem to be as many similar portrayals of boys?   ;I don   t see men as the evil heart of these stories. In the Hansel and Gretel tale Hansel initially takes the actions to save Gretel and himself, but in the end Gretel has to find the courage to take action and save them both. Another story that comes to mind is the Raven in which the woman initiates the action to free herself, but the hero needs to first rise above his weaknesses, and find the strength to free her. She initiated the action first though. I don   t see characters in any of these stories that are the bulging heroes in the movies we have today, male or female. Again the Raven has the example, seen in other tales where the hero goes out into the world, and attracts the characters of strength that actually overcome the hurdles. He is only the determined leader. Also As I   ve asked other places, do you think these are tales told by men, or women in the societies. I think they are more likely to be the tales the women have passed down and told to the children. I don   t see these as   tales the men would tell in their circles?  ;Wow thanks for those references.

After they divorced, neither of them had a lot of time to read to me before bed, and I was more against reading on my own than ever, because it required too much effort. I despised most of the books I was forced to read in high school, despite my sister's help. I was a stereotypical jock, for awhile, and reading was just not cool, anyway. Then, I got to college. My roommate was reading all the time, and wanting to talk about what he was reading with me. He loaned me a few books, like Slaughterhouse 5, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, The Lord of the Rings, and The Sun Also Rises. I've been an avid reader ever since and even joined a university book club! I have also revisited some of those high school books I hated and come to respect them (if not outright enjoy them). Well, except for Jane Eyre. I will forever hold a grudge against that book. Haha.;I'm kind of surprised at the anger the Grimm tales have caused with some people. First of all, I assumed as fantasy and sci-fi fans, most people had already read them (or at least versions of them). If the stories were so lame and meaningless, why are we still talking about them now? Why have they inspired an unlimited amount of retellings, art, essays, and historical research? I think many people are too quick to judge something that they 'hate' or think is pointless before they sit back and think about it on a deeper level. I used to judge things (especially books) too quickly when I was in high school. If I didn't like a book by the first few pages, I dismissed it as worthless. Now, though, I have learned to give things a bigger chance. There's a lot to be gleaned from the fairy tales, and all the other readings in this course if you give them all a fair chance.;Few people study the books that present a perfect world in which every character gets along with every other character, no one is judgmental, and there are no conflicts.

Look at this as a learning experience.;Karen:I was not saying that conflict means violence. Where did you get that? I meant, that any kind of controversial concept adds much to the reading (and without it, would be boring). Language, character attitudes, stereotypes, society, perspective or perception, etc.  Kate:Bear in mind, these books, or many of them, were written in a different time. People thought differently, society was different, etc. And though some would disagree with me, I think we have come a long way when it comes to prejudice and bigotry. It is still out there, though and just this fact alone makes it worthwhile to read books with bigotry displayed so that we can understand it from a variety of perspectives. And challenge it ourselves. That is the power of individuality. We don't need to be told by some disclaimer at the beginning of every book what to think.

In regards to the SF/F split (what makes something Sci-Fi and what makes something Fantasy) I think it is not so clear. Casey mentions that maybe this is similar to the split between science and religion, that science attempts to explain how everything is done while religion looks at it with awe and wonder. While this is a good point to bring up, I respectfully disagree to an extent. For instance, there is a lot of awe and wonder in science and a lot of trying to explain the why and wherefores in religion (though typically through methods quite different than the scientific method).  I speculate here, but indulge me a bit...is the main difference between Sci-Fi and Fantasy that the former incorporates technology and the latter incorporate magic? Somebody brought up Frankenstein. This is a wonderful example. Is this Sci-Fi? Is this Fantasy? Is this both? Does it matter?  ;Bryant,I know the creators of Grimm Fairytales personally.

Fantasy:   ""is the forming of mental images with strange or other worldly settings or characters; fiction which invites suspension of reality.""Fiction: ""can be defined as narrative literary works whose content is produced by the imagination and is not necessarily based on fact. In fiction something is feigned, invented, or imagined; a made-up story.""Source (with other definitions of genres):  http://genresofliterature.com/;Many good answers here.It's useful to conceive of any genre simply as a set of expectations. Broadly, all fiction involves fantasy in the sense of imagining what a character might say in some situation, or conceiving of what another character might do in some given context. But that conception of fantasy has more to do with reader reception, or perhaps, too, with authorial concerns, rather than specific kinds of subject matter.But when a friend says to you, ""Hey, let's go see a horror movie,"" your reaction will be informed by the set of expectations that come to mind. And these expectations are rather finely calibrated. Most people will fairly instantly understand the differences in their own expectations between a ""teen-horror flick"" -- transgressive sex, incidental cruelty, a cabin in the woods, punishment of both of these things by an indestructible monster with a horrible past and terrible disfigurement -- and, say, a ""psychological horror film"" -- a vulnerable protag with reason to doubt his own perceptions, a loving partner who only wants to help, a series of dark twists and shocking losses that drive toward the revelation that, oops, the loving partner's not so loving after all. There are many variations on the theme, sure, but only a few key categorical identifiers will signal lists of expected characters and plot points, along with a number of notable titles to be called into comparison.You'll know what to expect from a western, or a romance, or a family drama, and those expectations might extend beyond plot and character to tone, style, and even, sometimes, running time. When I think of fantasy, I'll probably immediately call Tolkien to mind, though others will think of George R. R. Martin. These authors both might have had different ideas about how fantasy can and should go -- there's wiggle room -- but the ways in which those authors' stories are similar probably do more to gauge audience expectations than the places in which they're different. We know, too, what we're getting into with sci-fi, for the most part, and sub-genres abound.For me, though, genre can be tricky, because it is a set of expectations based on easily identifiable signifiers. Genre can be so knee-jerk, in fact, that it can be entirely misleading, and so it's useful to keep historical and cultural context in mind. Some might think of  Twilight, for example, as a class of horror fiction, because of its engagement with vampire tropes, but for me it's a fantasy story that has far more to do with elves than vampires. That assertion might seem odd at first, but No  l Carroll, who writes about the horror genre, says in his essay, ""The Nature of Horror,"" that in order for a monster to be classified as belonging to the art-horror genre, it must be both threatening and impure. Carroll identifies impurity, if I remember correctly, as engendering in the positive protagonist a fundamental response of revulsion -- a desire not to be touched by the monster. The vampires in  Twilight can be suitably threatening (given the target audience), but they're seldom impure. Most of them are actually pretty cool, if not actually sexy, and given that significant portions of the story are set in the woods, where creatures who glow indulge their otherworldly powers, it becomes almost difficult not to expect Legolas to show up, bow in hand.Anyway, I hope that makes some sense. All the best.;There's another interesting aspect to Twilight that many people don't realize - Fifty Shades of Grey, published as a novel in its own right, began life as a Twilight fanfiction. There are some moral/ethical issues there, if not copyright ones, but it's a compelling discussion to delve into for anyone who is so inclined; we are, of course, all entitled to ""play"" in other authors' worlds (fanfiction has existed in one form or another as long as fiction itself has), but at what point does that play encroach on the original author's space? If Twilight is fantasy and Fifty Shades of Grey is romance, and Fifty Shades of Grey is a dressed up Twilight fanfiction with the serial numbers filed off, then does that make *Twilight* more romance than fantasy? The whole controversy demonstrates how malleable and arbitrary such labels can be.... yet no author can be published without knowing what labels fit their work (and which labels will work to sell books).That leads to a final interesting question - if genre labels are more of a simple selling tool than an accurate way to categorize books, then should we, as readers, pay attention to them at all?These questions are all debatable, by the way. I'd be happy to see discussion from anyone who doesn't think Twilight is fantasy, thinks that Fifty Shades of Grey is not at all overstepping authorial bounds, thinks genre labels are a distinct and vital tool, etc.;This was a discussion that a few friends of mine had.   Here's some responses ...I know, and the Science Fantasy category doesn't even include Star Wars, arguably the most well-known science fantasy of them all. In truth, you could argue that most science fiction is in fact science fantasy, and many bookstores include science fiction in the fantasy section. But in defense of Jane, she did specify books, not movies.Also, many of these categories bleed into each other. Harry Potter, for instance, is both Contemporary Fantasy and High Fantasy.Other examples of science fantasy:the John Carter seriesTerry Brooks' ShannaraDragon Ball ZMore Low Fantasy:Conan  The Green MilePreacher (wow, a map based on Preacher? Sign me up!)A Song of Fire and Ice is actually High Fantasy, not Low Fantasy. It has dragons and supernatural entities, for one thing. Low fantasy is primarily set in the ""real world,"" whatever that entails, while high fantasy takes place in a completely fictional world with its own laws of physics.Other high fantasy works:The Northern LightsThe Chronicles of NarniaDungeons and DragonsWheel of TimeDiscworldThe Dark Tower (elements of the supernatural, magic)Harry Potter (yes, it takes place in the contemporary world, but most of the action takes place in the wizarding world, which is definitely High Fantasy - wizards, dragons, mythological beasts, etc.)Alice in WonderlandMalazanThe Black Company (yes, it's dark, but it's in a different world with its own rules)For Contemporary Fantasy, you could have things likeThe Dresden FilesFablesThor (high fantasy as well)Hellboy (as Lovecraftian as comics get, so dark fantasy, too)Preacher (again!)Harry Potter (fits here, too)Lewis' That Hideous StrengthMary Poppins (hah!)His Dark Materials (again)more Dark Fantasy:The Dark Towerthe Elric booksThe Black CompanySo don't despair! High Fantasy is a broad enough category to contain many different types of maps....historical fantasy is my choice! whether in the realms of king arthur, norse gods, the pharaohs or something completely different, there is plenty of fertile ground for the imagination to bring forth a truly original work....Funny how different people use the same terms different ways. I would not say there is science fact in Star Trek, but I would call it ""hard"" sci-fi. Star Wars, with its mystical ""Force"" seems a little softer, leaning to science fantasy. (The Force was mystical to me in the original trilogy. I have heard indirectly that other stories have tried to give it more of a scientific basis, but I don't have anything first-hand on that.)...Science fiction is fantasy. We cannot travel at warp speed to distant planets. No one can carry around a light sword, who would not like a robot to do the house hold chores or to play with the kids. These three are science fiction, but also fantasy when played in the imagination of a 10 year old. Whilst science fiction and fantasy can be classed as two different things (sci-fi based on the plausable) you have a genre of fantasy call science fantasy. Stories that contain a mix of fantasy and science fiction elements. Trek and Wars belong in this category. Where does Avatar fit into the definition? Science fiction elements include the futuristic part, giant machines, space travel and Aliens. The fantasy part comes from the aliens though. They have no science. At the end of the film one character transforms from human to Na   vi, moves from the world of science fiction to that of fantasy.    Popular sicence fantasy include:Star Wars, Dune, The Golden Compass, The Gods of Mars, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy....I would not say there is science fact in Star Trek[Answered by]Hypospray - Injectors like this have been in use for many years.Personal communicators - who does not have a mobile telephone today?Phasers - wicked lasers spider 3 is the closest today    Universal Translator - these are now around.

It had to diagnose 10 different things.[[Answered by]Ah, but none of these things existed when Star Trek was created by Gene Roddenberry in the mid 1960's. In my mind, it is science fiction if plausible technological advancements could bring about the essential elements of the story, so clearly Star Trek falls into that category. You are almost making my point for me. But the human brain will never be a source of telekinetic power, so the Force remains fantasy. (Inb4 someone says Star Wars does not portray humans, but humanoids who lived ""long ago in a galaxy far far away"".)In my mind, science fiction is not fantasy. If it is supernatural, it is fantasy. If it might be natural, but we don't yet have the skills or evidence, then it can be science fiction. There is perhaps a spectrum between these two concepts: after all, Clarke's Third Law of Prediction is ""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.""Now you have me thinking about what distinguishes science fiction from ""mainstream"" fiction. In some ways, the ""CSI"" TV series are just barely science fiction in my mind, because what they do could be possible, but in reality, you do not get DNA results overnight. (But someday, perhaps we will.) And what about a novel like Harry Turtledove's ""Supervolcano: Eruption""? It describes an eruption in Yellowstone Park, the likes of which has not been seen in over 600,000 years, but which geologists recognize as a real possibility. But we don't know precisely what the effects would be, so it is speculative fiction (another term occasionally used instead of science fiction)....Science fiction is like pornography. You may not be able to describe it, but you know it when you see it.    This is the problem with polls that I think we can all agree on, no matter how it it worded or how many different subjects we place on them, people around the world will always have different definitions for them. When we start to draw this, a lot of leeway can be given to the artist to come up with something new....I chose contemporary fantasy ... partly because no-one else seems to be talking about it, partly because I had to look it up to properly understand it, partly because Artemis Fowl is one of my all time favourite stories, partly because of the cross-overs with other things (like 666 Park Ave, Under the Mountain, Lovecraft, The Man in Yellow and a  gazillion  other things) and partly because I like forging new roads rather than arguing old stuff!...Science fantasy was a toss up between A wrinkle in the skin and Starship Troopers. Both are fantastic books and probably rank in my best books of all time list.[John Christopher: A wrinkle in the Skin, Robert Heinlein: Starship Troopers]...Historical Fantasy.I suppose it's premature to speak of specific concepts, but I'm having an idea.

All are applicable, but the first two are too broad to be considered ""marketable"" (you need a more specific target genre), and the third.... well, as proud as I am of being a writer with a disability who incorporates disability issues into my work, I'm slightly uncomfortable with the pigeonholing that ""disability fiction"" implies. None of my work has ever been *about* disability - if I've done my job well, it's good fiction that incorporates characters who happen to be disabled as regular people. And the term ""disability fiction,"" or ""crip lit,"" as disabled writers irreverently call it, hasn't been around long enough for the average reader to grab hold of that idea... ablebodied people see the label ""disability fiction"" and think it's going to be a work *about* disability, instead of a work where disabled characters go about their daily lives (or solve mysteries, or fight aliens, or whatever... but at least in those cases, the writer has the option of the 'mystery' or 'sci fi' tag).Put another way, I don't take issue with the *term* ""disability fiction"" but I do take issue with the ""a very special episode!"", after school special, The More You Know connotations it realistically has for anyone not disabled. Anyone expecting trite platitudes or life lessons from my work would be shocked out of their shoes when they cracked it open to find a Dubliner with a penchant for using the F-word in as many creative ways as possible and her Brooklynite husband whose language is only a little more clean!I suspect your friend probably took issue with the fantasy label vis-a-vis his work because writing historical fiction involves *mountains* of research about the real history involved, and ""fantasy"" as a genre has a reputation for being something you can make up out of whole cloth. That's not true of course - the worldbuilding involved in creating a solid fantasy world is just as intense, even if you're researching as a starting point and going from there. But it's the same general problem in terms of the *perception* of the label by the general public vs. how difficult it actually is to write. ""Modern historical novel"" has a gravitas in the eyes of the reading public that ""fantasy"" doesn't.;"

Some aspects are kept, some are discarded as they are no longer fashionable or technologically applicable.  For example, one of the ""future"" inventions of the past was a machine that printed out a fresh newspaper for you at the breakfast table. I can't quite recall if this was thought up in the Fifties or early Sixties but don't you think that there is quite a lot of that time period at work? There's implicit roles set out - that most people would all still gather around a breakfast table before heading off to work or school, that people had time in the morning to read a newspaper. Even the concept of the newspaper itself is somewhat outdated since far more up-to-date news can be found through the Internet as and when it happens (which is why newspapers are going down the toilet and thus relying more heavily on opinion over...uh...news.).

As for travelling during the day, I'm not sure what chapter, but Helsing also says something like, ""Contrary to popular belief, vampires can travel during the day""   He tells us that their powers are severely limited.

In that book, clearly the relationship between Louis and Armand is very sexually charged, and the majority of vampires in the book are male.

Score is 2+2=4. I'm happy, but want to improve. A common theme in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass is the progression of childhood into adulthood, but the immaturity and irrationality of the adult figures show that Alice's vision of adulthood is often misleading. One of the best examples of Alice encountering immature adults is in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland during a tea party. The March Hare, the Hatter, and a dormouse are present and they contradict Alice with every remark to the point of absurdity. A tea party is often seen as a sophisticated pastime, but the three characters are juvenile in their behavior. The blending of the tea party with childish behaviors raises questions for Alice what it means to be an adult. Alice then travels to a garden where she encounters the queen playing a strange version of croquet. The queen is quick to throw a tantrum and flippantly orders for people to be decapitated. The king tries to pacify her, but he too fails to exhibit adult-like behavior by giving illogical arguments in a court proceeding. Alice later realizes that the highest authorities in the land are nothing but a deck of cards. Through the Looking-Glass also demonstrates the irrationality of adulthood. One example of this is in the poem, ""Jabberwocky."" Carroll uses fictitious words to parody the contemporary poetry and intellectualism of the time. Only Humpty Dumpty, the modern intellectual of Alice's dream, has the capacity to understand the poem. Ironically, he is a nursery rhyme character and is foolish enough to sit on a wall that he knows he may fall from. Even intellectuals are depicted as childish without common sense. The juvenile renderings of the events and characters in Alice's dreams raise into question the meaning of adulthood. As much as these stories tell of a girl growing up, they show that adults regularly exhibit child-like behaviors. Works cited  Carroll, Lewis. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, New York: MacMillan.

The grammar is correct and the essay well-written.  peer 2     Form and structure are clear, but could be more sophisticated. It is not so clear, what really should be the point: Alices journey to adulthood? The immaturity of adults? The immaturity of adults as Alice dreams them up? Longer parts of the essay are just re-telling of the story. Since length of the essays are so severly limited, it would have been essential to more deeply develop the analysis than retell the story.  peer 3     The essay is well structured and effective. Nothing negative to say.  peer 4     Excellent writing and structure  peer 5     Well formed. If you use a quote from the book make sure you use quotation marks.  peer 6     Your form is very good. You explain much without seeming like you are hopping around. Content:  peer 1     Your essay exposes and develops a thesis, and successfully supports it with examples from different parts of the books. However, there are some fragments too descriptive, like this one:    Alice then travels to a garden where she encounters the queen playing a strange version of croquet. The queen is quick to throw a tantrum and flippantly orders for people to be decapitated.    We already knew it, so you could have focused into the lack of adult-like behavior displayed by the king and the whole court.  peer 2     The journey to adulthood is an important topic of Carroll's books, many essays point to this. I am not so convinced about the point of immaturity of adults (which is a bit unclear in itself). The depicted ""immaturity"" could also be read as a hint to Alice's immaturity (it is she, after all, who dreams up the story).  peer 3     You make an interesting observation of the meaning of adulthood from a child   s point of view, which is genuine and show critical thinking. Although you should go deeper into the subject, since you give the examples but you don   t really develop your thesis.  peer 4     Terrific thesis, supporting details and analysis from throughout the text!  peer 5     I'm not sure about your comment 'Alice's vision of adulthood is misleading'. Do you mean that she saw adults as logical until she entered wonderland where that premise is put into question? I'm not sure how true that is, I think she found adults dull but not necessarily logical, she didn't understand adults in the normal world either. I agree that Carrol brings into question the rigid division between adult and child.  peer 6     I like your concept of the stories, however I do disagree with you. I found that it was Alice that was immature, rude and argumentative. But alas, I'm not here to grade our difference of opinions but how well you performed your essay. I feel you did very well. ;There is definitely hidden meaning in the fact that Van Helsing and Seward keep the ""transfusions"" a secret.Another comment, perhaps unrelated, is that many people in the time period would die from blood transfusions. Do we really know that Lucy died from Dracula's poison? More specifically, did Dracula intend for her to turn so quickly? As a vampire, she is no longer a form of sustenance for him.;I didn't mind Atlas Shrugged, aside from the 60 page (!) speech proselytizing objectivism. The Fountainhead was much better. I have her book on writing fiction and if you thought her novel was heavy-handed, you would groan all the more at her approach to writing fiction. Even the buildings are purposeful in expressing her ideologies.;I think it all depends on what you want to accomplish with your writing. If you are creating an escapist adventure or good beach read, then perhaps symbolism plays a lesser role and deep critical analysis is less important. If your writing is meant to express your ideologies in a way that people can relate to, then it would be beneficial to understand how symbolism is woven into classic novels. My favorite author is Gene Wolfe and his writing has puzzles within puzzles, unreliable narrators, and several levels of symbolism. I enjoy rereading his work, each time peeling back another layer of the onion. I enjoy it and could only dream of replicating some of his best works. For other people, they enjoy the reading and writing experience for all together different reasons. There is no right answer.;I'm going to try and read everything (we'll see how long it lasts!). Dracula was tough to finish, but having already read Frankenstein, I may read more quickly through it this time.The books I'm most interested in are the more contemporary works, like Bradbury and LeGuin.;There's already a thread for this topic:https://class.coursera.org/fantasysf-003/forum/thread?thread_id=289;Interesting topic... I don't think the novel is meant to downplay either faith or science -- they work hand-in-hand. Lucy is rejuvinated by blood transfusions. The Christian objects seem to have their power in the objects themselves rather than in the faith in those using them. It is no mistake that they are Christian objects as vampires are the antithesis of Christianity (in their form of communion, getting power from darkness, drinking of blood, which has sexual connotations).Van Helsing is the one who tells Mina that her scar will only be temprorary -- I never thought of him as  a Father figure, but he would be the closest one to it.;I lucked out this time. All are pretty good, in sharp contrast to last time. No ones and a couple of threes coming. ;I was under the impression that the mad man (his name escapes me at the moment) invited Dracula into the home where Mina was staying rather then her initiating the invitation. ;My take -- It shows Lucy as a mother figure and sets up a social hierarchy. The three women with Dracula were not allowed to have Harker and settled for a child. I almost wonder if it is masoginistic in that the new women cannot achieve free reign even in their nonconformity to Victorian ideals. Not sure on this one... ;I've read  three or four  novellas by him and several short stories. I am Legend is probably my favorite. I absolutely loved the ending -- especially the last sentence. I have the Library of America's Classic SF Novels of the 50s collection (which includes The Shrinking Man) -- surprisingly, I haven't gotten around to reading that story yet.One of the most memorable Twilight Zone  episodes I remember (watching as a child) was Button Button -- one of his short stories. I didn't watch his Star Trek episodes, but surely plan on checking them out.He will be missed and many of his stories are still as relevant today as they were when he wrote them.;"

TRUE,St373,Coh2,1,0,0,2,1044.39,0.001915,1,0,1,0.001297859,0,"On the surface, many of these tales seem far from a moral lesson. At least in the sense that we would understand them today. But I think that part of this is simply a cultural construct; we are so used to morality tales following the formula of ""righteous character is triumphant and succeeds, and wicked character gets just desserts"" that we have difficulty seeing the lesson in a tale that takes different forms. In the time that these tales developed, community was the fundamental rock of survival. The actions of one person could unravel the fabric of their society. Take for instance ""The Death of the Hen."" On the surface, this seems to be more a tale of   senseless injustice than a framework for right living. However, if we understand that it is meant more as a cautionary tale for lack of morality it makes a bit more sense. In a time when survival was often the only reward for being a morally upright person, this sort of tale would make far more sense to the average person than one of rags to riches; keep in mind that these were the tales of the common man, not the literati. Hence the name Hausm _rchen. With ""The Death of the Hen,"" the importance of honor and duty to community are emphasized. In addition, the interconnected of a community's members is also stressed. It is because the Hen, in her gluttony (a sin) breaks her oath, which in turn sets of a cascade of tragic events that ultimately destroys the community. We see this in the very delineated way in which the events progress, e.g., the Cock goes to the Brook to get some water for the choking hen, then goes to the Bride to get some silk, then to the willow to get the garland. All of these events and the ones that lead up to everyone's death are set in motion by the seemingly inconsequential action of the Hen breaking her oath. But in the times in which these stories developed, lack of commitment and faithfulness to one's community often meant death for that community, even the original transgression was not done out of malice. This is summed up by the last line: ""And they were all dead together"" (emphasis added).This sense of honor and duty are fundamental German virtues. So while the story does indeed have a tragic ending, that tragic ending is brought about by the failure to live up to the morality of the community. In this way the moral lesson is taught through what is lost, rather than what is gained.   ;Hello! I'm from Chicago too. Well, the Western suburbs, to be more precise.  ;"

For the dads I would even go further, not only are they useless, but they even are dangerous in some stories! I'm thinking of ""The 12 brothers"", in which the king wants to kill the boys if he has a girl. Or in ""Faithful John"" in which he doesn't hesitate to cut his twins' heads to release John.

Trust me, books meant for younger readers are often the most well written.  1.  The Lives of Christopher Chant by Diana Wynne Jones (love this author!)2. The Mysterious Benedict Society by Trenton Lee Stewart. (a very clever book. You'll enjoy it.)3. The Giver by Lois Lowry (a must read.)4. The Wind on Fire Trilogy by William Nicholson (I don't think this is very well known, but it's SO good.)5. The Princess Bride by William Goldman (a classic.)- Honorable Mention: Ella Enchanted by Gail Carson Levine. It's so funny!- I'm seconding the recommendation of A Wrinkle in Time by Madeleine L'Engle. That whole series is amazing. - I also loved the His Dark Materials Trilogy by Philip Pullman as already mentioned. -  Someone briefly mentioned The Chronicles of Narnia. I just reread all those books and I'd recommend just reading The Magician's Nephew. It's lesser known but really good storytelling and imagination. You'll see.;""Hans in Luck"" is the story of a boy who worked seven years for a lump of gold, but on the walk home to his mother traded it for a horse, traded the horse for the cow, and kept making trades until he only had a rock that he dropped. When I was reading this tale I thought it must be a story with a strong moral of the dangers of squandering your money.  Yet...the moral never came. The ending is ambiguous, and Hans is still happy. The reader doesn't know what will happen and can only guess how his mother will react when he gets home.  So then I thought that this must be a story about how you can be happy.  But no reader would want to follow Hans' example! We can see that Hans is so dumb to trade away all his possessions and be happy while he does it. Is the point of the story really that ""If you're really dumb, you can be happy no matter what""? What do you think the 'point' of this story is?;I remember that poem! I'm starting to think that that's all this story is about too, at least on the surface.;This is an interesting interpretation. Now that you mention how the stones weigh him down, it seems that each possession Hans comes by has a drawback   - the horse runs away, the cow doesn't give milk, etc, etc.  However, there are several things in the story which disagree with your interpretation. First, Hans is very happy from the beginning and doesn't seem to change as a character. And secondly, Hans WANTED the horse, cow, pig, etc very much. He desired the possessions because he didn't have them and thought they would make him happy, and once he had them he didn't want them, which seems to suggest ""The grass is greener on the other side."" To go with your interpretation, I guess you could say Hans is gradually losing his desire for any material possessions so in that way he does change. Kind of like a rich person who, after having everything, realizes things can't bring happiness.I think that relating this story to the creation story is a bit of a stretch, but I'll agree that 7 is a magical and spiritual number. So Hans is going on a spiritual journey of a kind. Very interesting! Thanks for sharing your thoughts.;When you put it that way, you're exactly right. It seems happiness depends on your perspective.Maybe this story is about how you can't judge others based on what you would have done because everyone is different. Grimm definitely seems to be playing with the reader's expectations and having a bit of a joke because the reader might think ""Oh no! Hans has given away 7 years of hard work!"" but Hans is happy about all his decisions.;Like so many others, nothing really inspired me...I was drawn to stories from the beginning. I believe children naturally are, and this inclination just has to be nurtured by teachers and parents. I've been a preschool teacher, and I love reading to groups of kids, and watching all of them be completely spellbound by the story. They are so into it! They eat it up! They can't get enough! I'm sure you've seen this yourself. People naturally love a good story.The real question should be: what inspired you to keep reading, to be a lifelong reader? For, so many people as they get older just get 'too busy' to read and put reading low on their priorities list after work, relationships, tv, money, whatever else it may be. But we all know how important reading actually is.  For me, I'm an introvert and more shy and reserved by nature. So growing up, reading was a way for me to live vicariously through characters. To explore far off lands and have adventures without having to leave the house. My mom encouraged my reading habit and we made regular trips to the library (she loves to read too). I was highly imaginative and reading fostered that creative and curious side of me. That's why growing up I loved fantasy and still continue to today.  ;I think that you need to approach this course and the stories themselves with an open mind. If you stop after the first story you'll miss some great ones. I am reading the stories a bit at a time and some are delightful, some are thought-provoking, some are strange, some are bizarre, and all of them have more to them than what's on the surface. I am finding them fun to read! So I'd urge you to give it another try. When you signed up for this course you did so to learn, as you have stated. But if you give up so quickly, how can you expect to learn? I personally was able to get the stories onto my kindle following the ""Send to Kindle"" link on this page. So I'd urge you to try again.;I just submitted mine. I liked the small word count. It forced me to be concise and simple with my writing. My essay was originally twice as long and I was able to shorten it. I am relieved that I was able to fit the word count and still make my point.High fives to those that are finished. And good luck if you're still writing! Don't worry about it too much.  ;Inspired by some of the discussions in the threads, I've been thinking about the themes in the Brothers Grimm and how we relate to them today. There are so many themes in these stories to talk about.Which themes are still alive in our culture today? These still feel relevant and we see them in movies, books, and throughout. They may look a little different now, but we can recognize them in the Brothers Grimm.  For example: The Cinderella motif. A mousy, outsider girl undergoes a transformation and gets the man of her dreams. I think we can all agree that we still love this idea and see it in many romance movies and books (even though we do away with other parts of the story).Which themes, on the other hand, are ""dead""? To us they might feel old and antiquated and we may even be angered by them.  For example: The theme of ""Staying in your Place"". In many Grimm stories the poor peasant who tries to be more than that is punished. These stories are from a more regimented society. In our democratic world, we prefer ""rags to riches"" stories instead, when a man who was poor becomes a millionaire. In fact if someone went around going ""The poor should stay poor and the rich should stay rich"" he'd probably get shot!Okay, your turn!  ;Some very good points! I think that the repetition draws out the story and builds the suspense. If there were no repetition the stories would be shorter and resolved quicker and just wouldn't be as interesting. The repetition makes you keep reading to see what will happen that third time.  You follow along with the story better, having some idea what will happen next, and having it happen 3 times seems to raise the stakes. Also there's something very pleasing about the pattern and repetition, like a song that repeats a catchy chorus. I agree that children like repetition and you see it in many children's books because it works.  ;I agree, it's really hard to swallow reading it now! Back then it was the norm for women to be treated like property or prizes to be won but I find it pretty terrible. Definitely, women had less rights, less of a say, and were thought of as lesser creatures in that time. Even though they certainly worked hard (spinning, cooking, cleaning, etc) and men were dependent on them!I have been thinking about the fact that all beautiful women in the stories are virtuous and good and the ugly women are evil or petty. So even back then all women were expected to be beautiful, and if they were not they were nothing! I imagine everyone would be nice to beautiful women but scorn ugly women and so their personalities would be influenced by that. So an ugly woman hated by society would turn bitter and jealous inside, and the stereotype would perpetuate.  There are definitely recurring character tropes in the Brothers Grimm. They were probably common characters in society's imagination. They seem to be shortcuts that made it easy for the Grimm brothers to write the stories. They didn't have to explain a character's personality. They just had to say 'beautiful princess' or 'mean step-mother' or 'youngest brother' or 'old king' and everyone could imagine what they were talking about so they could get on with the story.;"

Coming out of a worldwide recession you should realise the effects of inflation on the value of an item. So, subtract 150 years of inflation, the natural tendency for authors to exaggerate it would be a lot if he got $10 a year.But, this is gold we are talking about so the objective value may be far less than the subjective value at that time, which is what I think the authors were trying to illuminate through the story.;I used  this inflation calculator:  http://www.westegg.com/inflation/I'd look for  a similar calculator  for Germany, but it would probably be skewed by the hyperinflation of the 1920s.;As the text says ""as big as his head"", I think we should measure this by volume, not mass.   Considering the age in which this was written and the physical changes in stature from then to now in an average germanic young-adult (assuming he began his apprenticeship as early as 10 years old, he would then be 17, at the youngest), I'm guessing his head was roughly oval 6"" high, 5"" wide and 5"" deep.

A regular humanoid, on the other hand, would survive that much of a fall (albeit a few broken bones).As for the 150 fold increase, I'm still not convinced we're using the right equation. Neither do we know the weight of the frog or the prince.Impact (which would give us the possibility of a splat) would be measured by the deceleration caused by hitting the wall. Now that would lead us to the same result, but we take one more factor into consideration - gravity. Because the prince would be heavier than the frog, the secondary vector (that of gravity) would also increase, because of which the prince would hit the wall at an angle (if he even makes it that far - the increase in mXg should cause him to hit the floor rather than continue in the original trajectory) while the frog would hit it dead on.But, like I said, we don't know the distance, the size of the frog, or the muscle density of the princess' throwing arm (which I wager wouldn't be too much).;"

The Six Swans were redeemed from their fate by the sister's needlework; and it's a spinster in Sleeping Beauty who is the unwitting vehicle of fate--she is not able to change it. Maybe this is why in the Disney version, the spinster who lets the girl touch the spindle is the disguised evil fairy. Ah ha--a disguise! more cloth!   Good job on surfacing the relationship between cloth and fate. ;Thanks to all who are contributing to this thread! Here's my essay:                         Nearly half of the tales in Household Stories involve a beautiful character, often a girl or woman, whose beauty is important to the plot. Feminine beauty is used in three main ways: to elevate the woman's value as a reward; to display her internal goodness; or to contrast with negative personality traits, especially pride.    In stories like the Golden Goose, Queen Bee, Golden Bird, The Gallant Tailor, and Faithful John, a beautiful girl is either the motive for the central male character to go on a quest, or serves as a reward for a man who completes a seemingly impossible task (or both). The phrase    beautiful princess    sums up the importance of the character: she is a prize to be won, like wealth or power.    Beauty in girls of common birth (eg., a miller   s daughter) is often associated with positive character traits (   pleasant,       obedient,       industrious   ), or with an innate nobility. In    Brother and Sister,       The Six Swans,    and    Twelve Brothers,    a sister works diligently on a secret task to release her brother(s) from a spell. When a passing king takes the sister to his kingdom and marries her (presumably because of her beauty), an older woman (stepmother, witch, mother-in-law) accuses the new queen of deception. By completing the magical task, the young queen demonstrates her loyalty and innocence, and saves both her brother(s) and her own life. Her external appearance and character emerge as truly queenly.  The theme of the beautiful character in conflict with ugly, lazy, or evil female characters runs through many tales. When beauty and pride or vanity are combined in one character (evil queen in    Snow White;    proud princess in    King Thrushbeard   ), the tale ends with the punishment of the female character. She is either humiliated and redeemed, as in    The Frog Prince,    or executed by torture, like the evil queen in    Snow White.    In the Grimm's worldview, beauty should be more than skin deep.      ;Thanks to both Stephanie and Martha for your thoughtful comments on my essay. Martha--I tend to over-write, so the word count was a serious issue for me on this essay. I'll try to narrow my scope next time. i was looking for a cross-cutting theme that would use examples from many stories--my first draft was about 500 words. Stephanie, thanks for the specific suggestion of using the pretty/evil character as a counter example rather than just using it as a third example.

Good job! (On my next essay, I am going to try to emulate your spare introduction. I wasted a lot of words in my first paragraph saying what I was going to say.)Thanks for posting.;Hi, Karen. Is this your essay, or are you trying out a possible theme for feedback? If it's an essay, one thing to watch is your sentence structure. Your ideas are interesting--I now want to go look up the derivation of the word ""Grimoire""--but your writing is plagued with inclomplete sentences, so it is hard to see what your point is. If these are notes for an essay, i see several ideas that could be fleshed out, including the final point about power and anonymity. That's fascinating, and I'd like to hear more. Too bad it's time to move on to Alice (with a known author...although he did write under a pseudonym...hmm).Off to my ""big dictionary,"" as my kids call it, to look up Grimoire!Cheers! Enjoy the course.;Just looked up Grimoire in wikipedia--it's generally considered to be a book of magic or spells, although common household remedies might be included (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimoire). The use of ""Grimmerie"" in Gregory Maguire's Wicked series is an intentional reference to a book of spells. When I read Wicked, I thought the name of the magic book was actually a sly reference to the brothers Grimm, so this is an interesting thread for me. ;For the Grimm's tales especially, the concept of author  intent is not as important as it might be for a work like Alice in  Wonderland. The Grimms gathered stories, selected certain versions,  edited them, and may have rewritten some. But the ""authors"" were others  who lived before the Grimms. Many of the tales are folktales with a long  history of oral transmission, and the Grimms may have seen their role  more as anthropologists (albeit through a nationalistic prism) than  authors. They even included different versions of the same basic story as part of their own study of the stories and the people who told them.For the upcoming novels with a single known author, much can  be gained and understood by understanding something about the author's  time, background, and his/her intentional motives for composing the work, and the stated meaning if he or she explained that in their lifetime. But I  agree with Stephanie that additional interpretations by others are  interesting and valuable ways of exploring a work's relevance and  importance, in part because authors are not always aware of all of the  themes and meanings in their own works. I'm fairly certain that James  Joyce would be flabbergasted by the scholarly and popular  interpretations that have been lent to his work. That doesn't make the  author's intentional meaning less important, or the reader's  interpretation less meaningful. I think our challenge in this course is to engage with the professor and our colleagues, understand their comments and viewpoints, and come to our own understanding of the importance or lack of importance of the stories and themes for our lives and in our culture. If someone else's interpretation doesn't make any sense to you, fashion your own. Your interpretation may switch on a lightbulb for someone else.   ;"

It's a small book but being a southern brazilian of german descent myself, there are the stories I grew up listening. It may be my luck, but I had a grandmother who read a lot and used to retell the stories to me, rather than read them. I came to know Siegfried like this: The knight bathed in dragon's blood. Thanks to her I knew a closer version to the Grimm's ones before viewing the Disney movies.;that is, Kendal, the whole point of my essay by the way. By 1812 and the romantic era, be it in the Grimm Brothers, be it in Lord Byron, what we see is a reaction to the medieval morality and practice of seeing one's children as properties. The parent bargains away his child to the witch as a fair trade for some vegetables and the witch then treats her like a treasure, not a person. She, however, refuses to be just a treasure and secretly marries some random prince who happens to be brave enough to challenge that same conception. Note that there is no scene of the prince telling his king father that he met this peasant girl on a tower and will he please may have er for a wife even though she is obviously not noble born?;Sorry, coming of late here, but the Witch in Rapunzel is severe but, in a teutonic way, just. One may argue that the rampions were enchanted to look extra appealing, but that may also be said of a certain fruit of a certain tree on a vary famous garden.  As for the twins, well, they are the prince's son, obviously, since the narrator recalls Rapunzel as ""his wife"". The thing is, sex and marriage are portrayed as intrinsically correlated, many marriages in Grimm's stories are ""celebrated"" away from the family. There is a very protestant way of simplifying this: you make love to the one you love and that's who you marry.   At least in Rapunzel. The Witch is, in some way, the wronged one and in no moment in the story prior to discovering the girl had been comforting a man, was she cruel the the girl (Rapunzel did not want for food nor was abandonedd by her caretaker on the woods to die, nor had her father order the death of her 12 brothers for no reason whatsoever, i can go on almos forever ... ). There is something of an ""old bargaining god"" in the witch that calls to memory some of the stories in older germanic tales. Making her a Witch and giving the kniving girl a happy ending is a sign of a new morality. Think back to the greek myths and see what happens to a promised maiden who has sex (even though she was raped, something Rapunzel evidently was not): if Rapunzel's name were Medusa, her fate would have been much much worse and without hope of redemption.;Kendal, the word in the text is  wife, that to me says that Rapunzel's was not a rape. The idea being that a person is not a thing and, unlike things, even if you try and hide them, they find their way into the world (in her case, through her singing).;The thing about oral sotries is that, they mutate, Katrina. You may think of Rapunzel as an imprisioned child, but you can also see that as a metaphore for a ""protected treasure"". One of the older versions of medusa is that her ""seduction"" was actually a rape, being Medusa outside to gather flowers for the temple. It is a story so resonant in times of ""slut walks"" that it might result in a thread of itself, though one might argue that the ""robber's bridesmaid"" has a closer relation to Medusa's myth. There is, in both of them, a modern morality where the women are not to be eternally persecuted for not bowing to the strongest force, be it male or supernatural.;NEVER, EVER APOLLOGIZE FOR CORRECTING SOMEONE. This is how we learn.Please, it is a pleasure to learn and it does not shame me at all. I learned to read by reading greek myth and to me it comes almost as the same way the Grimm tales come, clouded in a fog of oral tradition, but that is good, I guess. So, thank you for reminding me of that earlier medusa story. Of course I am not defending that you coup up a child in a tower, that was some of my point, the tale tells of a new way of seeing people, the romantic way, not as properties as women have been during the middle ages. What I was saying is that the Witch isn't wicked ""from her perspective"", the old perspective, the fundamentalist perspective where people and goods are interchangeable. It is no coincidence that Rapunzel and Rampio are similar (in portuguese the plant is called Rapuncio), the whitch see's both as the same, as things that are desirable but belong to her. As I first stated, shehas more the workings of an old god, as opposed to the christian (protestant) view of tolerance and forgiveness.;Three is the common sense human number for ""this is no longer a coincidence"". Peter denies Jesus three times to let the early christian underestand how much he is deserving of his later contrition and forgiveness. It was not a scared man's response, it was a true denial, and thus his confession of the sin makes the forgiveness that deal greater. In these stories too the three appears as that proof that something is inequivocal.  ;I agree with Sarah here. Repetition comes through as both mnemonic and suspense though, given their intended audience, character's character also is built on repetitions of their action, and are usually seen as being consistently wicked, consistently good or consistently loyal.;Take the Fisherman's Wife, repetition here in the calling of the man of the sea is giving you the hopelessness of the husband under a manipulating overachieving wife.  As a side note, it's the basic archetype used to create Jorah Mormont in Game of Thrones.;there is also a correlation of ""marrying"" and ""having sex"", as seen in Rapunzel, the King's son ""visits"" Rapunzel over a fortnight and then finds her much later with their two children. Many other marriages in Grimm's stories happen away from friends anda family.;Thanks for your comments. I do believe the stories are child appropriate, however, especially today. There was an awareness that people would marry in their teen during the 1800s, so you need to prepare children to deal with adult world. Somewhat during the late 1800s and 1900s we started protecting the children more (some may blame queen Victoria and the puritans). However, today, with the access to absurd amounts of misinformation, telling our children that the world is not just roses, that one strong must use his/her strengh to protect the weaker, etc. There is an urgency in bettering our education to toughen our kids. The world is a beautifull place, but beauty is not the same as innocent.;That is why I said in an earlier comment that I find this stories well in need to be told as is to the children. At least you have a parent there guiding them through the morality and wuestions that may arise.  ;One may say that the whole point of all these tales, in regard for children is:The world is a dangerous place, but if you are clever, brave and fight for the right reasons, you will end up being happy in a way or the other.;Adding to that, being happy is not always marrying the prince or princess or being wealthy beyond measure. Look at Clever Greathel, or the Four brothers who rescue the princess but decide neither to marry her ...  ;Re-reading these stories I got the urge to listen to them, the way the Grimm heard them.

FALSE,St388,Coh2,1,0,0,2,1086.96,0.00184,2,0,2,0.001946788,0,"I think there are several different things going on. First, many contemporary writers and other novelists have used fairy tales as inspiration, or have alluded to them. This makes sense as well if you think of how hearing these stories might have been among the earliest memories some writers have, and if you believe as some do that fairy tale elements represent some kind of primal archetypes of the subconscious (Jungian interpretation). So allusions may be conscious and well as unconscious.  At the same time, you'll hear varying versions of these tales, both across cultures and even within European culture. The Grimm brothers collected these oral tales by traveling around the countryside. In many cases, as I understand it, they heard different versions and then picked and chose those elements they wanted to include. They may have cleaned up things and added some narrative consistency or causality. Then you have a variety of translators such as Lucy Crane or Padraic Column (the first version of Grimm tales I read) who translated the Grimms tales into English and so made other changes as well. Other compilers/authors such as Perrault or even HC Andersen put their own spin on these motifs. So the results are varying versions of the same stories. It's interesting to compare the versions and look for which differences might have resulted from the translation, or from whoever first wrote them down (perhaps taking a bit of literary license), or from the oral tradition itself.It's also interesting to me to see the parallels between many of these stories and folk tales from other cultures. For example, many cultures around the world have a version of the Cinderella tale. This seems to support, perhaps, the Jungian read, though perhaps it also speaks to cultural sharing and influence. It's hard to know what the original oral versions of these tales might have been, and how much has been changed over time.  In terms of literary interpretations of the fairy tales, I'd definitely recommend the novel Possession by A.S. Byatt. One of the characters is an 19th century English Victorian poet who writes her own versions of fairy tales, definitely influenced by Grimms.  ;It is also my understanding that while the Grimms compiled oral tales, they put a bit of their own spin on them for their own purposes, or at least consistent with German romanticism movement. As I understand it, they also were dealing with varying versions of the same tales and had to pick and choose what to include. It's also interesting reading different translations of Grimm tales. The first translation I read was by Padraic Colum, which I'd recommend. It seems somewhat less adorned and more matter of fact than the Lucy Crane, but of course also doesn't have the same evocative illustrations. One thing I've heard and reflected on is that the original stories (partly as reflected in the Colum translation) are very matter of fact about the things that happen. Life was quite arbitrary and could be cruel. Children who strayed in the forest could be eaten by wolves, sickness could carry people away quite randomly. One thing that strikes me about fairy tales is how both the fantastic and the horrible are related and accepted without comment. One thing I did note in the Crane translation was a bit more of an overlay of morality. That bad things happen to bad people, rather than the more arbitrary kind of fate that may hang over the earlier stories. Perhaps a touch of English Victorian morality? But I've also heard that the Grimms gave a bit of this kind of overlay as well. It's hard to know without being privvy to the original oral versions. Another thing I notice is a kind of merciless treatment of foolishness or distraction. Poor Clever Else -- that kind of cleverness (looking for trouble when none is around, day dreaming instead of working) was not to be tolerated. You can sometimes peel back the veils -- it seems to me -- and get a glimpse of what life truly must have been like back then living on the edge of the forest, and the edge of subsistence and violence.  ;"

I feel that the author does a great job of conveying the atrocities that occur during a war and how everyone takes things such as rape and pillaging a given, however horrific they are. I sometimes had a difficult time reading the books because of all the blatant violence against women and had to put the book down for a few weeks. I think, however, that the political intrigue is spot on and entertaining. My favorite characters are Dany, Tyrion, and Arya because they are balanced in their view of morality and survival, which is why their characters have lasted so long while others that see the world as black or white have died. On a side note, if you enjoyed or enjoy reading The Song of Fire and Ice series, I suggest reading the Wheel of Time series. It's much longer (I believe it's 14 books), but it's less consistently violent and the author actually does a better job of embodying the characters in their separate narratives (including calling certain characters different names in the narrative, not just the dialogue). It also has very strong female characters that are all perceptively different. It also has strong political intrigue that makes you want to keep reading. I read both series at the same time and I enjoyed both. ;My husband said the story is telling us not to help our friends. He said this jokingly, of course. ;I remember having an epic nightmare where the Red Queen was trying to cut off my head and I was running through a tunnel that never ended.

They made these tales to be cautionary warnings for children, especially young girls to prevent them from going down the wrong path. What many people tend to neglect when they are analyzing older works is that due to the age that children were married, which was much earlier, many precautionary tales explained concepts that many assume would not be talked of, such as procraetion, and finding the right husband. Young women were also far more vulnerable than they are today, as they had to fear dangers such as lustful men, and the shame associated with having a child out of wedlock. As long as we look at these fables, keeping in mind the societal paradigms of the era, the brothers Grimm would be gald, as they had done their job. As writers, they were meant to entertain, but they prided themselves on being the teachers of the next generation also. They wanted tradition to prevail, and for young people to be ready for the reality of their world.;I don't know if this will help, but usually rabbits are associated with the character flaw of fleeting, of not being permenant, or committed.

I will try to explain my line of thinking on the religion thing. So, the first indicator for me, was the way in which some stories are so heavily veiled that the 'hidden'   meaning or parable can be completely missed by most readers at first glance. This reminded me of the way that strict religion can impart wisdom on themes that may be distasteful to their moral viewpoint ( promiscuity in 'The Rabbit's Wife', or the protection afforded by the three drops of blood in 'The Goose Girl as a metaphor for menstruation, meaning the female is 'safe' and protected from pregnancy) and also, the recurring symbolism invoked by the trinity, or groups of three as a metaphor for the holy trinity, ( the three miraculous items needed to ascend the glass mountain leading to the reward of saving the princess as a metaphor for the trinity of God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit leading to the reward of eternal life and Heaven). Threes are also seen as a good thing in some of the other stories. I am still reading so there may well be more of this. I used the example of an Amish child being taught life lessons because it is the strictest religious modern lifestyle I could think of that would come close to the type of communities people must have lived in at the time these stories were transcribed.;Hi, I too am reading the pdf version and I felt exactly the same at first.

I only suggest you have a look in case you were too distracted/annoyed by the crappy format to analyse at all.

Personally I find it morally inexcusable to kill a child in either case, but it does make sense within a values system that exalts faith and obedience to a higher power above all else.

However, the same vitality and passion that can make one an appealing sex partner can also sometimes fuel aggressive and temperamental behavior (his bullying of the girl). ;Interesting...

I was too focused on the rabbit. :-) That ties a lot of these themes together very neatly right from from the start- if the rabbit represents the male and the cabbage patch represents the female, and the first thing we learn in the story is that the mother fears that rabbit is a danger to the cabbage patch... ;Taking a little inspiration from the Bride and Switch thread here, I also wanted to talk about a TvTrope I was reminded of when reading The Brother And Sister-  No Ontological Inertia http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOntologicalInertia It references, among other things, the preponderance of stories that involve spells breaking once the original spellcaster is gone- ie the fawn becoming human again once the witch is executed. This is definitely not the first time I've seen a fairy tale appeal to this rule of magic, and I was wondering why. Is it just a convenient plot device to secure a happy ending, or is there a deeper significance? Anyway, I just wanted to open the floor to opinions because I wasn't really sure myself... I did have a sort of fuzzy idea that it was related to religion in some way- there are lots of stories going back to the ancient world showing God/the gods putting constant effort into keeping the world running on a day to day basis (Apollo's daily chariot ride, for example)- and that maybe magic is supposed to work in a similar way to divine power. But I don't know. ;It wouldn't be the first time... In the Bible, Eve and Adam are punished for eating fruit that they have been told will make them like God. Arachne is punished for bragging that her weaving is better than the goddess Athena's even though a weaving contest between the two shows that this is actually true.  However, I wouldn't discount the greed angle entirely- looking to seize divine power could very well be read as the ultimate form of greed. Alternately, you could say that the story shows that material wealth and success can go to people's head and make them believe that they truly are/deserve to be like gods (there are many reak world examples throughout history of the rich and powerful behaving this way). ;"

I'm wondering why the more-or-less-ten authors studied in this class are the ones who are studied. Everybody (I suppose) can add very famous authors in this list. Is it because the chosen authors wrote shorts stories and others do not ? Or is it because they are free to read ? Or something else ?I had been surprised too that nearly none of the authors are non-english speaking authors. There is only one, the Grimm brothers, and I don't deny their strenght but Maupassant, Goethe or Gogol are major authors in fantasy litterature, and I'm sure there exist english versions from their stories.Thirdly, the list begins in XVIIIth century. I'm very glad to see that Aesop is in the course's introduction, but why are the ten authors so late in history ? People had stories maybe from the beginning ot times : I think about Homer and ancient greeks, or mythology and gods all over the world. Is it to avoid speaking about gods ? Of course it could lead very far from litterature, but if we have an interest on fantasy, it may be an very decent start and I would like to understand why they are missing.Thank you for reading ! ;"

Also, it is important to consider, as a prof, that the students do not have the same level of reading skills, understanding or rate of learning. In other words, we could be ""sitting"" next to a guy who writes sf novels for a living or next to a guy who is actually just trying to begin a more active reading lifestyle. Thus, this can make it a bit complex from the standpoint of the teachers (I am assuming).As for the works themselves, I believe ancient mythology and storytelling is quintessential to the well-versed mind of a fiction writer / reader, but there are several factors to consider. First of all, time. We can spend an entire decade studying fiction from the early beginnings of man to our modern era and we would not be even close to finishing. Secondly, because relatively ""modern"" tales and stories are more into context with our contemporary world. It is no easy task to have a full, in-depth analysis of Dracula which considers the psychological, sociological and cultural impact on western culture and writing. But it is something completely different to have this same analysis on a work like The Odyssey, where the context of Greek culture and history is basic to the understanding of the story. Therefore, relatively modern stories are more accessible (and I use this term loosely) from a contextual point of view.This is of course, just my wild guess on the selection of the tales for the course. ;1. Ringworld - Larry Niven2. Starship Troopers - Robert A. Heinlein 3. Ender's Game - Orson Scott Card4. Hidden Empire - Kevin J. Anderson5.

You can look at this as at the history of the human nature and mind , and that is why just a list of some findings not enriching us at all. The problem is WHY we are still repeating this patterns.And, yes the answer: it is all about ancient rituals. As a Halloween. Memory of  the childhood of the Society.  ;I will not say I have studied Propp. I just read few of his books when I was 12-13 years old an this was a long time ago. But 3 of his main works are very interesting : Morphology of the Fairytale, Historical Roots of the Magic Fairytale and Ritual Laughter in the Folklore.( translation of the titles mine, mean  :not good). In the first work he is brilliantly analyzing the structure of the fairytale, on second scrupulously showing connections between every detail of the fairytale and details of the initiation ritual and in the third bringing a new idea of the sacred laughter.          I am not very good with Internet search and I did not find second and third books in English translation, but the first, "" Morphology"" looks popular enough . P. S.  And in the  Historical Roots of the Magic Fairytale , Propp working a lot of with Frazer' s materials.  P.P.S.

All Alice pattern repeating classic  preCristian stories, which in its own turn repeating the pattern of the initiation rituals( think Grim's Mother Snowbed: Fall in a well and instead dying finding the magic land , traveling there, meeting supernatural characters and returning back to the earth more strong , more rich or even with some extra power. )          But each new time level adding a new meaning to the old pattern.  ( As Professor Rabkin pointing on association with Garden of Eden, not The Land of Ancestors).           All of this repetitions  unintentional , just using century proved powerful structure to deliver own ideas to the audience. It is just an old  good carriage for the new fruits. If Greg will use the same pattern for his work ,it does not mean he want to convince  his young readers to believe in a power of spirits, just people always will eat  familiar food, better than green eggs and hem.

Feel free to ask :)Best wishes,Roxy.;I remember that in childhood Grimm's tales were not my favourite(Anderson's were), but still these stories excited imagination and I was allured to them. However, the tales I read were not as dark as original versions we read now but no were they soft, innocence adaptations for children. What do I think for these dark stories with witches, ravens, blood, death being introduced to children?I think, fairy tales today have two main purposes:introducing kids to the world in a illustrative, exciting manner and teaching the first lessons/morals;enrich imagination and entertain;When it comes to the first purpose, dark stories may not be perfect but still they are much better than naive adaptations in that - the world is not perfect and it will never be, children may experience some inner problems that they won't be aware of or ready to talk to adults. Dark stories help kids a) to realize that world is not always fair in an illustrative, playful manner; b) cope with stresses, problems they won't discuss with adults. Yes, definitely, there should be trust between kid and parent but sometimes it's not achievable.Personal example: I had very tough childhood with parents being divorced and me living with neither of them, feeling outsider at kindergarten and school(since all of my peers had families). Two fairy tale stories that helped me to ""survive"" this time and most likely mitigate the psychological trauma were not happy adaptations of originals, even though they were not dark:  Ugly Duckling  by Christian Andersen and I don't remember the second except plot(girl had a chance to choose whether she would be poor and miserable and suffer in the beginning of life but live good life later or vice verse). As a kid, I used main characters as ""role models"" and since both of them had happy ends, ""surviving"" was much easier.  I can't say so much onto the second point. I guess, eliminating all the darkness from the stories will do more harm than good because darkness is an important part of human nature as well as it's alluring for all the ages. Maybe, it's just part of who we are. Maybe, kids need to face and be aware of these dark moments to fight the further fears as the heroes of fairy tales. However, I believe that original stories like we had this week are not suitable for kids. It's all about golden mean.;Peer-reviews enhance one's learning. That's a fact. But self-assessment after the peer-reviews can help to make one's works better because after seeing other's mistakes or perfect works, a person can give her/himself a good feedback, seeing the own work with a new perspective.This course is awesome, and the only one that seems to be missing is the ability to self-assess yourself after peer-evaluation.

Looking forward to checking out Murakami.;I saw something a little different in  Little Brother.   It is a coming of age story.   Its lessons may or may not have been learned by Marcus. The business of government is power and control and it will go to any lengths to perpetuate itself.   I was in my late teens and early 20s during most of the Viet Nam war.   The question on everyone's mind was: Why are we there? Anybody know?The answer that seems to ring true with me is in ""America Betrays Herself in Viet Nam"" in  The March of Folly by the great Barbara W. Tuchman.   Once America was sold the frame (I like that concept...it is clarifying)   ""being tough on communism,"" politicians had painted themselves into a corner. None were willing to extricate us from the absurdity of the Viet Nam war and creating the career-ending perception that they were ""soft on communism.""   The practical results of this ""do, say anything to stay in power"" attitude was that the kids from my neighborhood that I had played with at recess were getting shot and blown up in Asia for no good reason.Many of us didn't like it and the heart-breaking angst we felt when National Guardsmen shot and killed anti-war protesters at Kent State University was profound.The lesson I learned (and perhaps Marcus failed to learn because good fortune provided him with an influential investigative reporter) was: the government will lie to you, put you in jail or send you to your death if it serves its ends.   Free speech, freedom of assembly and the rights to privacy are myths for the uninitiated.   I agree with John that once action and the governmental reaction was framed as a ""war on terror"" Marcus had already lost the debate.   The moral of the story to me: unless you are wealthy and have good attorneys on retainer, try not to engage in open hostilities with the police state.   Keep a low profile...keep your head down and your mouth shut.   Say, ""yes sir"" and then once you are clear THEN engage in whatever subversive activities you must to fight the powers that be.  ;This course is just for fun...not a matter of life and death.   I'm enjoying it because I rarely read fantasy or science fiction, so I thought I would learn something a little different for me and achieve a new perspective perhaps.   I have read some of the books over the years and I'm not totally unfamiliar with the genre.   I read slowly for enjoyment and there is no way I can get through every written word recommended in this course, but I can be selective and spend time with what is of greatest interest to me.

To be honest I cant remember the titles of the other texts we read, will have to dig them up from the back of my bookshelf! But Im always open to new titles to check out ;Now that I am in my fifties and I have a teenage son, I love YA dystopia. In my younger years I read everything that came along the best seller list. I read everything that was labeled ""classic."" I gorged on Stephen King horror books, and I had a Harlequin romance subscription! Yes, don't laugh...I received a free wine glass with every book. Finally, I found my true loves: John Steinbeck, Native American authors, and creative nonfiction. But science fiction, especially wild dystopias, hold a spell over me. They are titillating because they just might come true. They weave in the possible with the impossible in such a spellbinding morbid way. As in the Hunger Games, we visit isolated communities based on a class system with people raised to perform certain hideous tasks. It is reminiscent of our society today: theme schools for the poor, isolated neighborhoods without services, wild packs of dogs attacking pedestrians, and health care for the rich. Dystopias are like a scream for help, and they captivate us with their injustice. Maybe they are not shelved in the library with science fiction, but they certainly contain the concepts.;Me three.;I've not read or seen The Hunger Games (though I did read a brilliant essay on how the series, and other novels, reinforce false ideas about violence and trauma on combat veteran-turned-peace activist Paul K Chappell's website). People I know who've done so all enjoyed the books, but seemed fairly evenly split about the films.;I really enjoy Dystopian novels. Thanks for the recommendations in this thread! I have always considered Dystopian stories as fantasy because often the author identifies a main flaw in society and imagines what our world could become because of this flaw. For instance, The Giver is a very simple yet powerful Dystopian story. Many freedoms are taken from the people in order to keep them ignorant and controlled, yet they are taken care of. In our modern day society, people still struggle between finding the right balance between liberties and safety. If you are interested in Dystopian literature, this is truly a great novel to pick up.;Faith,There is also a fourth book now to finish out the quartet (""Son"") if you haven't read it. I found it to be a really great finish to what was already a great series by Lowry.;The concepts of Utopia/Dystopia seem to arise from the possibilities of future developments. We've always known as a species that technology could be our savior, or our downfall; and so it's interesting to explore both possibilities. As in most things I say, I'll reference Philip K. Dick as both the exception and the rule. In most of his more popular writings, he explored the dystopian repercussions of technologies that had already come and gone (which also side-steps the over explaining problem); and in some, he simply represented a surprisingly mundane world that happened to have odd technologies.;Going through my copy against the ones we're supposed to read I noticed I am missing a number of them.

Most people will offer their readers a new insight and some detailed reference to the text that argues for the significance of that insight and for an appreciation of how that detail functions, so most essays will enrich our reading and earn a 2. Some essays will be astonishingly new or persuasive or useful by making the story much richer and even by helping you understand better how to read stories in general. Such essays earn a 3 in Content, but no more than 20% of the grades should be a 3 because, by definition, ""outstanding"" is comparatively rare. Most grades should be 2.""  Should I grade based on the insight and new knowledge the essay has given me or how it would affect other readers in general?    From the essays I'm assigned to grade, two of them don't offer some new insight or enrich my understanding of the Grimm stories in general (or a specific one) while one of them interprets a story in a particular but quite obvious and mundane way.

The  collecting of m _rchen    from storytellers seems to fit well as a mechanism for the philiological research. The oral tradition of storytelling is a universal constant, as are fairytales, as discussed by Professor Rabkin.  The story tellers will put on different voices for characters, and act out scenes in their stories. They are not only sharing the story, or the moral of the story, they are sharing deep held hopes and fears, beliefs and part of their local cultre. Analysing the sounds of the language you ascertain regional changes. I am a Scot who lives in Switzerland with my German husband. His dialect, Schw _bisch, from W _rtemburg, is very different than that of my work colleagues from Baden. Yet Baden W _rtemburg  is classed as one ""state"" of Germany. Even in relatively small distances the  changes in the spoken language are noticeable. Switzerland   has 4 official languages, but the majority of the population are Swiss German speakers. The  problem is that the Swiss German dialects change rapidly as you travel aroud the country and there is no official written Swiss language. The vowel sounds change from canton to canton, different words are used for the same object, and for German colleagues, it can be almost impenetrable. I can clearly see why this part of the world would be interesting to a Philologist. ;I believe that the wife of one of the brothers also contributed to stories that they put in print.

On the one hand, the Grimm brothers might have been trying to accurately represent the stories that existed in the oral tradition. Notice that there are many similarities between stories. For example, in both ""The Wolf and the Seven Goslings"" (40) and ""Little Red Cap"" (132), the wolf eats a main character whole, and someone else comes along, cuts the wolf up, rescues the person swallowed whole, and fills the wolf with stones. Other stories seemed to be repeats, too, with just a few elements changed. Thus it seems the Grimm brothers were trying to be academic about their project, rather than artistic or entertaining--trying to accurately represent, to preserve, the oral tradition that existed in these areas.On the other hand, in writing the stories down, the Grimm brothers created The Definitive Text. After they wrote the stories down, the stories were not purely oral anymore. It's the difference between your mom reading you a story, on one hand, and telling you the story about your great grandparents meeting and getting married. In the oral tradition, certain details can be emphasized or changed to reflect a need at that particular time. Notice the stories that emphasize the industriousness of the characters--industriousness as a virtue equal to kindness, patience and faithfulness. This rise of industriousness is absolutely consistent with the times during which the stories were written down: During the 19th century, as industry was growing more prominent, wealth and success--rank in society--could be earned rather than exclusively inherited. What we don't have--what we can only imagine or guess at--is what these stories would have been like, say, a hundred or two hundred years before they were written down. There certainly wasn't one story told the same way all the time in all the houses in all the areas in all the land, but I would guess that ghosts of an earlier time still linger in the stories we have today. Some of them seem similar to Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. For example, the archetype of the miller exists in both. I think it's important to read these stories with an eye on their oral histories, but also with recognition of the fact that what we have access to is not the oral tradition itself, but a snapshot taken at a very specific time. ;The story of Faithful John reminds me of a story from the Christian Bible, of Abraham and his son Isaac. At some point, God commanded Abraham to sacrifice his son. Obedience would show that Abraham held God and God's commands over Abraham's own desires. From what I remember of the story, Abraham followed God's command, but at the last moment, God interrupted the sacrifice. It was, after all, only a test of Abraham's loyalty and obedience. As Abraham passed the test, so God spared Isaac before the sacrifice was even committed.;This story reminds me of Erasmus's Praise of Folly, where Dame Folly--Folly herself!--describes the virtues of foolishness. Reading it, you wonder at Erasmus's opinion: is Folly wholly bad, or is she/it really, really to be praised? Is there really some virtue to being foolish? Erasmus, a humanist, was possibly aiming to complicate readers' assumptions and preconceptions. ""Hans in Luck,"" originating in an oral tradition, might simply be an amusing tale. Everyone has known a foolish person who's made a very unwise investment, and so everyone hearing the tale (or reading it, for that matter) can laugh about it. And I believe each and every one of us is similarly guilty of making unwise investments, and many of us continue to be foolishly happy or satisfied about them.But this story does make one think, doesn't it? About whether or not Hans really is lucky?;"

There's the entire third time lucky thing which we see a lot here - the third time there's a different result (to pull an example, in the first story, the third time the rabbit asks the maiden jumps on his tail). There's also the idea that accidents always happen in threes - apparently an idea connected to Peter denying Christ three times. ;I presumed that since she'd tried to shoo him twice before and he'd come back she thought the only way her family would be rid of him for good was if she went with him. ;I have to agree that I really don't read ignorance in it. The Cock isn't ignorant when he goes to fetch the water - he's doing what he perceives he has to in order to save the Hen, his wife. What is he ignorant of here, exactly? And when the animals follow on he's not ignorant, or at least the moral isn't that ignorance kills or it would be he who died and not them as if they do harbor some malignant intent then he's ignorant of they're punished for it, not him. I'm also not sure what point you think the cock's missing at the end. I think it's a bit of a tricky one. Unless the moral is meant to be don't be greedy or EVERYONE DIES which...actually that could work but then the story should be from the hen's perspective. ;I agree very much. To an extent I can accept that picking up these books is going to expose me to a level of sexist and racist language that is going to make me uncomfortable and by acknowledging that before I start I can at least accept it. Sometimes things strike me out of the left field though. I've made one attempt at reading a Bond novel and I was expecting the sexism and the racism but I got blindsided by the homophobia. I presume part of the reason for choosing so many older texts is to make the course more accessible for those of us on smaller budgets but, yeah, some of these readings are going to be quite difficult. ;Repetition is a powerful tool for learning. Remember that these stories were intended to impart lessons to their audiences, they weren't just for entertainment, so being easily remembered was a bonus. I think an element of it is that these were oral tales. If you're narrating a story - especially to children, you don't say ""he did it three times..."" You say ""he did it, and it didn't work! Then he tried again, and it still didn't work. And then he tried AGAIN and THIS TIME...""   It builds anticipation into the story, particularly as we expect that different outcome the third time so it builds to it. If he achieved the first time it wouldn't be as meaningful (an achievement is always worth more if you fail first). I think that's much less effective in writing then read out loud. It also makes a part of the story familiar which promotes engagement with it. These stories were moral tales - intended to teach lessons. It was important that they were engaging and memorable. Repetition is a strong memory tool and by repeating the audience learns as they go so they can join in with reciting the story which gives them a sense of personal investment in it. ;Who says your wrong? Your ideas were the best ideas you had in light of the information you had at the time. I hate this idea that you're 'wrong' if you don't immediately jump to the solution that scholars who've dedicated large portions of their life to studying something have reached.   Also, presuming somehow you have made some horrible blunder and claimed the sky is green and you are obviously and irreconcilably wrong. Why is that a bad thing? To start with, this is a safe space to be wrong. I don't know you. You don't know me. What does it matter to you what I think of you? It doesn't. You'll never meet me so this is the ultimate safe space as no judgement any of us make on you here will ever have any impact in the real world. Second, sometimes being 'wrong' is good. Nobody's expecting you to hand in a work of scholarly brilliance for your first essay. They're not expecting it for your last essay - what they're expecting though is that you'll grow. Part of growing is getting stuff wrong. What did you get wrong and why? Did you not think closely enough about the cultural background? Because that's a lesson for next time. Did you infer something about the authors that was wrong? Because that's a lesson for next time. Did you not consider an element of the text? Because that is a lesson though the lesson there may be that you can't consider everything. In much the way Grimm's tales were influenced by their culture, our essays and readings are going to be influenced by our cultures and ideas. I think what might also help you is refocusing a little. Ultimately this class isn't about learning about twelve books. That's an exciting element of it but what it's trying to do it make you in to a more thoughtful reader which is a skill you can take with you. When you're picking up a novel from your shelf someone won't stop by and lecture you on it before you begin - but you don't need that crutch to draw meaningful analysis from a story and that's the skill this course is trying to give you - an ability to draw meaningful analysis without having to be told what the outcome of that analysis is first. And maybe your meaning will never be the one the scholars give but if you get more meaning and pleasure from reading isn't that an end in itself? ;Well said, Daniel. It seems to me that a bad pedagogy is one that's based on regurgitating remembered 'facts' instead of critical thinking and developing cognitive skills which allow you to generate your own meaningful ideas. Which is also exactly what I think is wrong with the education system as a whole and the changes Michael Gove is making in the UK specifically but don't even get me started, you won't like me when I talk politics and education. I think the part of your argument I disagree with, Jerard, is that you're thinking the 'meat' of the course will be the taught material and the reading is meant to supplement that. I'm looking at it the other way round. To me the 'meat', the point, is the time I spend reading the books. It's how I can already feel myself developing as a more thoughtful and attentive reader and the lectures are there for me as a supplementary resource but they'd bias my reading if I had them before I read as I'd be looking for what the lecturer had told me about, not finding meaning for myself in the text. I think, ultimately, the thing is that with a literature course there aren't necessarily right answers and that's kind of upsetting. I get that, in my other-life I'm a science teacher but this isn't like science - there aren't absolutes and the only wrong answer is the one you can't support. Your answer isn't wrong because it doesn't match the interpretation the course has given you, just different, and ultimately if those videos had been released at the start we'd have a plethora of essays about those videos and those interpretations, not about the source text. ;That's really interesting. I like the idea of the unpredictability of Wonderland being the unpredictability of the adult world to a child. It also makes sense of Alice's uses of lessons. In Wonderland though less in looking glass she constantly attempt to understand and control her surroundings by applying the 'lessons' she has been taught in school - the things that are meant to enable her to function in the adult world - and she's constantly thwarted. That makes a lot of sense as we do teach kids a lot of things in school we insist they're going to need in the real world and ultimately most of them won't help them control or interpret their world (not that those things are meaningless but that they don't have this practical application we insist on). ;I'm not sure what you mean by symbolism of the name. Can you expand on that a little. I thought you meant what the name symbolises as in the image it creates for the reader but you're talking about the scene where Alice loses her name so do you more mean the symbolism of names as in what does the possession of a name symbolise? Names generally symbolise identify - to strip someone of their name is to remove their identity as an individual (think prisoner or soldiers being addressed be a number or rank or whatever - the intent is to remove their identity, their individuality, and make them something else). I think Alice losing her name is mostly to do with her losing her sense of self - something that's a recurring theme across both books. Sorry if I'm entirely off target there. ;I'm going to disagree, actually. I think that if the videos were released earlier people would watch them earlier and it would bias their reading. I very much like the aspect of the course where we're forced to present our own interpretation before we're allowed access to opinions that are likely to bias our own. It means we actually have to read and think and process. The course is very time intensive but I would point out that once the videos are released they are there for the rest of the course. If those 48 hours are your busiest then just mark during that time (the marking doesn't take long) and then watch the videos the day after before starting the next reading. I don't think it's possible to entirely avoid overlapping the readings on this course due to the length of some of them (I don't think it's possible to read Dracula in 4 days) so that's just an aspect you'll have to deal with. The only argument I can see is for early release of the 'start of reading' videos for each book but they might recap ideas from earlier lectures so if that's the case I can see the argument for not doing it too. ;"

But if the original folklore was cruel it would be nice to read the stories that were passed through centuries and represent a culture, rather than the censored versions that meet a critic or publisher's criteria.  ;I think that stories passed through years of recounting would become more stream lined naturally, the folklore would only contain necessary details as people only remember those.

TRUE,St493,Coh3,1,0,0,2,3.75628,0.532442,1,0,1,0.002259887,0,"I was very intrigued by the use of color as allegory throughout many of the tales, and chose the topic for my first paper. Researching the meaning of the color red, in particular, provided many insights into the reading of the tales. Through studies, red has been found to be the color first perceived by infants, and even the first color recognized in patients who have suffered traumatic brain injuries that affect their visual perception. To Neolitiic peoples red was likely considered the most important color. This can be seen by their placement of red ochre in graves, and the use of the pigment in cave paintings, used to depict animals to conjure fertility and good hunting. The word 'magic' translates to 'tarfur' in Old Norse, and is related to the Anglo-Saxon word 'teafor' which means 'red ochre.'A common belief in the pre-Medieval and Medieval eras in Europe saw the color red offering protective powers against evil influence. Objects, animals and trees were covered with red pigment, and warriors painted axes, spears and catapults covered in red paint to endow the weapons with magic power. Some Australian aboriginies still follow this practice today.  Both Neolithic hunters and Germanic warriors used to paint their weapons and bodies with the blood of slain animals, and Roman gladiators drank the blood of dying adversaries to take their strength. In some cultures babies were even bathed in blood of strong, good-looking animals, so as to absorb their strength.  Red painted amulets or gems were used as charms against the 'evil eye,' and wearing a ruby was thought to bring about invincibility against bad omens or ill health. Bed-clothing was customarily red in Germany up to the middle ages, and used as a protection against 'red illnesses,' such as fevers, rashes and miscarriages. Garlands and scarves of the color were part of wedding customs in many areas, and indeed red veils are still worn by brides in some south-eastern European countries.  The brides were wrapped in a fiery red veil, likely used to symbolize love and fertility.  In Germany red wedding gowns were fashionable into the 18th century, but was a custom dating back to the Roman era. To this day, red is still the gown choice of color for Chinese brides, who are carried in a red litter, and walk on a red carpet. Neighbors even bring red eggs when a couple welcomes a child.  A red rose is seen as a symbol of love and fidelity. In Greek legend the red rose sprung from the blood of Adonis, and it symbolizes the cycle of growth and decay, but also love and affinity, and was dedicated to the goddess Aphrodite. In christianity it symbolizes the cross and Christ's bloodshed, and the Israelites' painted their door frames with blood to scare demons away.  Even the phoenix, or firebird, was associated with cleansing and renewal, and promised good fortune and longevity. Fire, and by affinity the color red itself, was seen as giving life itself, providing both warmth and protection.In the texts we see the use of the color red as allegory for protection, or stages of trials to achieve a desired goal.  For Clever Grethel the wearing of her red heels make her feel special, and others in the village see her as feeling self-important, due to the color of the shoes. In the Death of the Hen, the bride wanted red silk in trade; and in The Three Little Men In The Woods, the finding of the red strawberries is her reward for her kindness and help.  In both The Goose Girl and Little Red Cap, we see the use of red objects as protection. The Queen offers a cloth with three drops of her blood to her daughter, and the red cap was a offering of love and protection by her mother.We see the use of red in trials in both The Raven and Faithful John. In The Raven, one of the sets of horses used to ferry her were red, and in Faithful John a red horse comes from the heavens as the first of three trials he confronts for the King. In the Six Soldiers of Fortune, the iron of the floor was turned red-hot in an attempt to kill them, but is ultimately the second of three trials they overcome to win their fortune. The red flag used in The Twelve Brothers can be seen as protection by their mother, as this is their warning signal to escape their deaths.  In Roland, the protagonist changes herself into a red milestone, a marker with which her love could find her again. Also in Snow White, we see the Queen receive her with for a child with the spilling of the thee red drops of her blood. Also the eating of the red poisoned apple, ultimately leads her to her love. Finally, the iron shoes being heated red-hot and placed on the Queen, sees the end of the threat to her life.Any thoughts on this reading of the texts?;I think that is a very relevant and interesting way of looking at the text. Especially considering the books can be read almost as a 'coming of age tale' for Alice's character. The many correlations that can be drawn between her growing up and losing her childlike innocence, and what occurs to her throughout the book are quite clear. Her discomfort and frustration at never being the right size, and losing control of parts of her body, such as her neck, are upsetting to her. Her effort the enter the 'idyllic garden' can represent her desire to hold on to her childhood and innocence also. The train can represent the movement ever closer to adulthood, and away from her childhood. Also, the White Knight character who comes to her aid is later forced to abandon her when she is ready to move into becoming a 'queen,' which can also be seen as a metaphor for growing up.   I have found that as I age I look more and more into the meanings of texts, in particular from a woman's perspective.  ;"

The story starts at or around St. George's day, and St. George's flag is iconically red & white. Black, too, features, in Dracula's heart, in the night he operates under, and so on. An interesting topic, and some great comments - thanks for sharing!;He may be a cad, but he is at least sensitive enough to feel guilt for it; your true cad barely notices. Anyway, a half formed thought about shame:I argue below that the creation of the monster is, essentially, a masturbatory act. This, in some ways, is shameful enough, but it does not entirely explain Victor's reaction to the monster. I think it's worth considering the context of the book, and in particular the rather tangled biographical details that surround its writing. I think there are parallels to be drawn between Victor, the scientist creator, and Percy Bysse Shelley, the creative poet. Not in that Shelley writes ugly poetry, but in considering the circumstances of his elopement with Mary - not, in fact, his wife in 1816, but ""the other woman"".Shelley at that time was still married to Harriet Westbrook, with whom he had had a child in 1813. He had abandoned both to pursue other women, including the various Godwin sisters. I personally feel that Frankenstein's guilt and shame reflect, in part, something of Percy Shelley's guilt and shame at that act, and that Victor's deep misery is both sexual and parental - coded shame for a regretted sexual entanglement (one the limited biographical details on Wiki suggest Percy came to feel was 'beneath him') and guilt at parental abandonment. Elizabeth herself suspects Victor of having an affair, and the monster, dreadful evidence of a prior 'wanton' liason, exacts his revenge on their wedding night - and few things are likely to spoil a bride's wedding night like the discovery of the bridegroom's bastard child.;For what it's worth, one of Percy's pen-names was Victor, and according to Wiki he spent time at university experimenting with the sciences.;I think it goes a bit deeper than teasing...! He separated from his first wife, who died shortly after the publication of Frankenstein. Looked at from the perspective of a man who recently left his child, much like Victor fleeing the monster, the books becomes even darker than it already seems. ;The gender roles is certainly a good observation. Victor is certainly trying to be god, but doing so in the only way he knows how - by mimicking (in himself) both male and female. Take the moment he, uh, comes to his breakthrough in chapter 4:....to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was the most gratifying consummation of my toils. But this discovery was so great and overwhelming that all the steps by which I had been progressively led to it were obliterated...Now, I feel there's a fairly high probability an 18 year old on a romantic foreign holiday with her sexy poet husband knew perfectly well what she was writing about here, but I don't think we need to bicker about awareness to see foreplay, orgasm, and the little death. Progressive steps obliterated indeed.What's interesting, though, is the words before that: After so much time spent in painful labour...Labour, of course, being both work, and giving birth, and complicating Victor as man and as gestating woman. Throughout the creation of the monster, Victor uses labour; having inseminated himself, he must give birth. God creates man from nothing in a day; woman creates man* from man in 9 months. Poor Victor, working only with himself, labours to a two year term - and yet still is male:still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased, I brought my work [not labour, here] near to a conclusion....   *or woman, obviously.;Didn't occur to him along the way, didn't think about the consequences, didn't happen 5 mins earlier...You know, those absences happen a lot with teenagers and young men, except possibly for the 5 minutes earlier bit.;Interesting essay, although I think it might benefit from considering Dracula   s consummated male victims; he may rape women, but he destroys men. He kills two men that I recall, besides the crew of the ship, the retired sailor in Whitby & his foreign, and thus lower class, shipping agent in Galatz, both by ripping out their throats. He is, it seems, not interested in middle class men (though those intense male friendships, with Stoker so quick to reassure us they involve nothing more than a manly pat on the shoulder...). Given the role of rent boy rough trade in the Wilde trial, destroying the evidence - as well as the symbology of destructive homosexual desire in the excessive nature of the wounds (throats torn out, as if by a wild animal, not simply bitten, yet still in the same eroticised zone) - does make a certain amount of sense. I like the point Sean made earlier about the mix up between carnal and carnivorous, but I do think there are ways to read the book without necessarily queering the Count.That said, I think that looking forward to Freud's theories of sexual development, where certain stages have to be passed through before sexuality fastens on its proper object, the opposite sex, throws an interesting light on Dracula   s sexuality. You can certainly suggest the Count's desires are not completely gendered, and Helsing repeatedly describes him as having a child brain; he is sexually transgressive; and he can change shape. In short, as Mary suggested earlier, Freud's infantile polymorphous pervert.    ;I agree, Angela! I've actually enjoyed the book, but - even if you haven't liked it - I think it's worth listening to the Dracula lecture on words and the one on timelessness to see why it might be an important book.;Oh,  they work less these days. ;Our anonymous friend's joke can be read in (at least) two ways. One is the rather snide meaning I think you have picked out- that the working class are as inferior as ever; one is the rather more bitter observation - in line with my suggestion that the working class are disempowered in Dracula - that nothing has changed. A third interpretation is the long running (and frankly, perfectly justifiable) gag about the English & our drinking habits, one Stoker's friend Wilde also made: Work is the curse of the drinking classes. Any way Anon meant it, at the least I applaud the use of the feed line.As for my joke, there's a poisonous tendency in the mainstream political and social conversation in the UK at the moment (you may be British; I don't know) to classify working class people as striving or skiving - exactly the same as the Victorian deserving or undeserving; working hard or working less. The flip side of that is, again, the bitter truth that there simply aren't many working class jobs available anymore. In my area of the UK (Newcastle) unemployment outside the middle class bastions ran at 30-40% during the 80s, when the traditional industries of the area (coal mining & ship building) were gutted, & it's still 20% or more in the worst hit formerly working class areas. Working less, again.For what it's worth, I'd say that ""the working class"" or at least the socially disadvantaged, are openly legitimate targets in political and (public) social discourse in the UK in ways that are no longer tolerated for blacks or women - Chav, for example, if you know it, is a pretty vile term in wide use, and I already mentioned skivers. Not that I'm saying there isn't equal/worse discrimination displayed in other ways against the groups that you mention, mind.Sorry to bang on about it, but given that I had just written three paragraphs about the exclusion of the working class, I had thought I'd earned a slightly more charitable reading... :);The unsupervisedplay suggests they were definitely  working class - middle class children were much more circumscribed; look at Alice who must make her adventures inside her house and from a dream of running away. ;""People start believing...""  You mean they, the poor uncritical sheep, right, not us? Oddly, I find myself strangely uncharitable, right now, too.;Thanks for taking the time to reply, and accept my apology for being a bit grumpy today; it partly explains why I was offended by the bracketing with the kind of  us you imply, and why I didn't really appreciate being told I should factor in your encouragement, or lack of it, in my choice of topic - patronising, is how it reads.I tried a lengthy dissection, but think I am over-analysing. I see your point, although I don't wholly agree - because saying black people work less* entirely spoils the point of the joke about the working class working less. My joke was meant  to be satiric, and I'm sorry that wasn't clear enough in the original post. If you still read it a different way & are offended - I apologise, wholeheartedly; it's always a risk with satire. The first line was an (obviously failed, and unnecessarily snarky) attempt to try to point out how your words can be ungenerously interpreted, if someone so chose. You don't believe the stereotypes you refer to, so when you say  People... what you really mean is Other people (they) are stupid, can't think critically, and believe what they're told. Now who's making offensive generalisations? http://xkcd.com/610/ Anyway, I'll think a bit more about it; see if my ego is just up in arms at the moment. Apologies again.*edit: That is, I don't think there's a balancing counter-interpretation to the overtly racist stereotype of lazy black people to give the comment any satiric edge - it's just a nasty racist comment. Consider what happens if you substitute other groups; use women or gays, and the comment quickly becomes just weird, or stupid, because those groups have different associated stereotypes.   ;It should do now - and I know exactly the problem with forums; I come across as an over-analytic lecturing bore sometimes, and God knows how that happens. Pax?(Oh, and I did understand why you read it that way - which is why I wanted to clarify);Sorry to hear that, Yoly, though I don't know if this is the best place to talk about it. If you enjoy reading the book, I wouldn't worry too much about the essay, and just concentrate on finishing the book. Most of the other books are a bit shorter, so you may find them easier to finish. I'm guessing you're not a native English speaker, so you might find it a bit more challenging to get everything read and written. Just relax about it, and do what you can! I teach foreign students English, so I'm very impressed you're even trying - I know a lot of my students couldn't manage it. Good luck!;Yep, excellent essay. I can see your point about lack of clarity in the thesis, and I think you could possibly have developed her redemption (it is her husband to be who stakes her in the end) but I'd have probably given it 3 for form, and certainly for content. The comment about poor Georgie is an extremely astute piece of reading, and that's an elegant way of handling quotation without affecting the word count, one I'll be using in future.The essay prompted me to reconsider her name, actually. Westerner/Westenra ties in with the point you make about her somnabulism - western culture sleepwalking into danger - although that may have fallen outside the scope of your essay. The -ra, though, is interesting, since Ra is the Egyptian god of the sun, and her first name means light; I certainly think that is an example of Stoker ironising her chief characteristic, which is that everything happens to her at night (edit: just noticed a comment in another thread that her name could be read as light from the west - i.e. sunset. Much more   appropriate). More directly in line with your thesis, the etymological connection with Lucifer damns her from the start.Anyway, a successful essay. I do have a few minor quibbles - but given the storm & stress going on in rest of the assignments forum, feel free to ignore them. Briefly, it's actually four men who symbolically rape her (everyone has a go - Holmwood, Seward, Van Helsing, and Morris); I'm not sure about the word order in narrative Victorian determinacy (Victorian narrative determinacy, surely?); it's entendre, not ententre (brain slip, I'm sure); and I think, though the meaning is clear, the grammar of the last sentence of the second last paragraph is ambiguous - the opening participle clause has no clear referent, since the two closest nouns are Stoker and her behaviour. I apologise for the nitpicking; feels faintly churlish to do it in public.   Thanks for sharing.;Here's mine; I was in a hurry, so it was shamelessly plagiarised from a post I made in The Role of Christianity, https://class.coursera.org/fantasysf-003/forum/thread?thread_id=413 . I think the point about physical structure is valid, given the format, and I'd agree with the relevant reviewers that the conclusion is a bit weak - particular props to the reviewer who points out that I take on trust the importance of the soul; on consideration, there is something rather performatively excessive about the number of references made to the soul. There is at least one missing comma, and take a look at Sean Tobias May's essay just above for a better way of inserting quotes. In  Dracula, the primary horror of the undead state is not diet or  circumstance, but a Christian fear of damnation. Throughout the book,  the main motivation for the protagonists is the saving of souls rather  than lives.    This is evident in the events of the plot, the language and arguments  the characters use, and in how Dracula is portrayed explicitly as an  avatar of the devil, whose chief concern is the corruption of souls.  Considering Lucy   s second death, Helsing justifies it with reference to  the soul (   the soul of the poor lady  _ shall again be free   , Ch16) , and  this is instrumental in convincing Arthur to play his part - Lucy's soul  needs to be saved before it is tainted irrevocably by killing an  innocent. Likewise, Mina   s inevitable damnation is the reason the group  chase Dracula after he has left England (   The stake we play for is life  and death, or more than these   , Helsing, Ch. 25). This concern with soul  is also present in much of the dialogue. Throughout the book, all the  characters, and Helsing in particular, refer to the soul. In a telling  dialogue with Renfield, Seward discomfits Renfield with the notion of  the souls of creatures he consumes buzzing around him (   He dreads the    _burden of a soul"", Harker, Ch. 20 )     and it is shortly after this that  Renfield tries to break free from Dracula   s control. Finally, the clear  connection between Dracula and the devil himself, evident in both the  descriptive language used to describe the count (hellish; diabolical),  the root of his name (Romanian: Dracul, devil) and even his pseudonym in  London (de Ville) suggest Dracula   s real threat, which is to the soul,  not the body.    While Stoker   s relationship with scepticism, faith and Christianity  is complex, the metaphysical horror of the book for its original  audience comes from the damnation forced on the victim by the murderous  appetites of undeath.Formpeer 1      Clear thesis, but the second paragraph should be split up multiple ones  to make the physical structure as organized as the logical structure.  The sentences beginning with ""The concern of soul"" (missing an 's', by  the way) and ""Finally,"" both mark the beginning of related, but separate  thoughts.  peer 2     Very good essay, very well written, and the best of the five that I've evaluated this unit.peer 3      Clear, lucid prose. I have no suggestions other than perhaps a break in  the second paragraph would aid reading on a screen. Smaller paragraphs  are easier on the eyes.peer 4      This essay is very clear and well written. The vocabulary is powerful  and has a positive impact on the reader. The only phrase I found strange  was:suggest Dracula   s real threat, which is to the soul, not the body. I  would have written it like this: Dracula  s real threat is to the soul,  not the body.  It  s something minor anyway , this essay is very clear.peer 5     Althought there are some grammar mistakes they don't impede the reading. The essay is clear and well-organised.(2)Contentpeer 1      Good thoughts that are well supported, but I thought the conclusion was  sort of weak.

You're right in that  we tend to think of how the book affects us, and not how it affected  contemporary audiences.peer 3      This was the most insightful essay I've read yet in this course. A  clear thesis is backed up by ample evidence (though no evidence is given  that for the original audience, the idea of damnation was more horrific  than vampirism itself.) Strong writing.peer 4      I liked the argument very much. The author has given very specific  examples from the text and makes quite a compelling case. Well done!peer 5      I really like how you connect your main ideas with extracts from the  book, because it is clearer to understand. Very interesting connection  not only with Christianity, but also with Christian fears.(3 - generous, I think);Thanks for posting that quote, P. Klein. Interesting, and certainly matches themes in the 1831 edition I'm reading. ;I wrestled with this issue a bit. The suggested Google edition is scanned and horribly typo'd; I found it pretty unreadable. I looked at the Amazon text (which is definitely the 1818 one) but found a proofread version of the 1831 text on Gutenberg Press. This is the link:  http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42324  and there is a mobi file available for the kindle. The introduction is quite interesting, actually, and worth reading. Shelley says she made some minor changes to the style of the first few chapters, but I don't know how significant they are. ;Just getting started, and having read through the intro and the letters, I noticed a lot of references to Coleridge's Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner. The letter writer makes reference to the poem explicitly, and Vincent's role - warning Walton about the dangers he faces - is similar to that of the Mariner in the poem. I found something vaguely familiar about the iceberg scene, but couldn't quite place it, and won't have time to look at the poem until later. Just wondering if anyone has anything more concrete on the connection, or more generally on Shelley and Coleridge.Looking forward, also, I was struck by the book's relationship to A Wizard of Earthsea (by Ursula K. Le Guin, who we're reading later, and if you're doing this course and haven't read it, that should be the very first book you pick up after the course finishes). Like Frankenstein (and also with echoes of Dracula) Ged tries, hubristically, to bring forth life, or at least truly resurrect a dead person, but ends up with a monster who he then has to chase to the ends of the world. Curious echo.;In the end, I actually developed my thesis influenced by the ending of  the Wizard of Earthsea, and thinking about the importance of names, both  symbolically and as essential parts of our social identity.;I was trying to avoid spoilers,  but the (actually not quite core) story of the cloned worker is the one I was thinking of; life created without care for the life itself. ;Hello Royce! Yes, that's an interesting observation, although the nesting is more complex in Cloud Atlas. Did your friend also tell you that the monster's great great grand-daughter is hidden in the core of the book? It's worth reading if you get the chance, although I'd also recommend one of his other books, Ghostwritten. The science-fictional aspects of both are fairly bleak, however!Following on from my initial observation, I've been trying to identify some of the influences and allusions in the book, although exploring them in any depth is a hopeless task given the time constraints. I hope one of the lectures will deal with the references! Anyway, a few more:Faust (both Goethe and Marlowe) - occultists like the young Frankenstein, and archetypal investigators into things what man was not meant to wot.Shakespeare - The Tempest, in particular, Prospero (a master of magical arts who shuts himself away insolitude for study, abandoning his duties) & Caliban (the monster), and Prospero and Miranda (compare the monster watching the cottagers, who, like the washed ashore characters of the Tempest, are actually nobility, made wretched, with Miranda:   How many goodly creatures are there here! How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world, That has such people in't!) Hamlet, the very model of the modern miserable intellectual gets a look in too, with echoes of his despair and guilt present in Victor.Paradise Lost, very obviously.Childe Harold, I am fairly sure, though it has been a long time since I read it.The romantic poets, generally, and in a host of ways - the importance of nature, imagination, and solitude being just 3 I picked out, and empathy/sympathy has just occurred to me. Austen - Mansfield park gets a specific reference (pretty Miss Mansfield...) in the letter about Justine's history, although I am unsure whether the following clause (her ugly sister Manon (Mammon) has married the banker) is a gag about what Austen's novels are about underneath the pretty surface, or a reference to another novel; Austen's domestic, tiny worlds are lightly mocked in the introduction; and there seems to be a mild anxiety of influence at play - although judging by the comments in the Drama Queen thread, it's pretty clear Austen's won that particular challenge....and I'm sure there's many, many more.;Good post, John. That solitude is a key issue, and I think it's an interesting one to consider in the context of her original audience; writers & romantics who laid great importance on solitude, especially in nature. A cautionary tale, perhaps?;Hello Laurie!Like Florencia, I'm afraid I have quite the opposite problem! I'm not quite sure if Florencia means she will be doing a close analysis of a particular incident (e.g. looking at the moment when Frankenstein & the monster meet, and thinking about how this incident reflects wider themes, or discussing the marked change in language in this section) or picking out a single word (or a group of related words) and discussing how they are used throughout the book, but if you're ever stuck for ideas, these are both good approaches.Some of the ideas I've been considering:Weather - You might look at the differences between the moments when the weather is calm, and those when it is violent. You could also consider how Frankenstein's moods are reflected in or described by the weather - he is forever raging like a storm or a whirlwind, or shrouded in a fog of despair.Nature - At the beginning of the book, Victor sees nature as something to be conquered (the root of Victor, in fact), but he becomes ever more sympathetic to nature - his moment of peace, before he meets the monster for the first time, is found in the mountains. Nature and its enjoyment was a key concept for the Romantic poets, too. Connected with that is the travelogue elements of the book - reading it, I suddenly wanted to visit the alps.Sociality vs. Solitude - Victor embraces (in many different ways...) solitude throughout the book,and especially at University, (in a city - a place reliant on social, but not familial, relationships) but the monster sees solitude as terrible. Bearing in mind the original audience, a group of poets and writers, you can see the book as a cautionary tale about Solitary Vices. Fancy & the imagination- These words crop up again and again in the book, and they are words very strongly associated with the Romantic poets Shelley was involved with. There are ways you can see Victor as a frustrated poet, not a scientist. Walton, his framing parallel, tries and fails to be a poet; Victor occasionally describes what he does as art, not science; and the monster describes language as a science when he is learning it. Chimeric, a word we use now for illusion, is a reference to a fantastical monster made of many parts, and this, too, crops up a lot. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimera_%28mythology%29  Desire & knowledge - For both Victor and the monster the pursuit of knowledge is highly sexualised - look at how of the word ardent/ardently/ardour (passionate) are used for their studies. I discussed this a bit in the drama queen thread already, and it connects with the themes the Professor as already drawn our attention to, about the dangers of knowledge, its sexualisation, and its connection with notions of the fall and so on. Prometheus - the subtitle is The Modern Prometheus. You might like to consider the original Prometheus myths and its variants, and the ways in which Victor does & doesn't resemble Prometheus - you could even argue that aspects of the monster echo Prometheus. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus )If I have time, I'll put some observations about names up later (good spot on Felix, Florencia!) John Graham has posted some interesting things about justice, guilt, and shame, and if I was fantastically learned and had 3 weeks, I'd certainly discuss literary allusion in the book - but there's much more - the relationship of parent and child, the narrative structure, the importance of the word daemon...Anyway, hope that helps! Good luck with the essay.;A bit late, but now I've finished and fled from my Creature - maybe not hideous, but perhaps hideously boring - I'd point out that you can both be right. Although I don't think the monster is  literally Satan, he certainly claims a satanic status, and Victor, while still believing himself the creator, fantasizes about throwing the monster from precipes, from cliffs - the Satanic fall. Yet by the end of the book, Victor himself identifies with Satan: Like the archangel who aspired to omnipotence, I am chained in an eternal hell.;The same.I am actually an EFL teacher, so I'm fairly tolerant about form, especially if I am certain the writer is a foreign student of English. It's worth noting that it is perfectly possible for a student to succeed at a university course with less than perfect English; content matters more than form for most university courses, and even English related courses do not expect native level English from students. Cambridge University, for example, asks for an 8 at IELTS (the academic English exam used for entrance to most British universities) for linguistics and literature MAs, and less for other courses. 9 is native speaker level (and some native speakers would struggle to qualify :D) - at 8, ""some errors do persist"" and the IELTS writing descriptor asks for ""the majority"" (not all) sentences to be constructed accurately. In terms of this course, it should be perfectly possible for a well structured and coherent essay from a foreign speaker to get at least a 2. That said, if it causes you as much difficulty as you suggest, 1 is the best mark.One other thing - while systematic errors like the missing -s  might be noticeable, that is not always a good guide to the seriousness of the error. The -s, in particular, along with irregular past tenses, are notoriously difficult areas for most students, and even otherwise extremely high level speakers (i.e., band 8, & good enough to study English Literature at Cambridge University) sometimes make these mistakes. This is because English is irregularly and only partially inflected, and it is especially difficult for speakers from languages with virtually no inflection, like Chinese. Articles and prepositions are other areas that people often fuss about, but again, these are areas that cause all except very high level learners problems - and yet rarely detract from the meaning. A few people have talked about the difficulties of grading foreign language students. If you are genuinely interested in doing justice to non-native speaker essays (and good for you if you are!) , I'd take a look at the IELTS band descriptors - http://www.ielts.org/pdf/UOBDs_WritingT2.pdf . Anything at 7 or above with a strong structure and good organisation should, in my opinion, be at least a contender for a 2.      ;...native speakers struggling to have a good score in the IELTS should tell you something about the validity of the test.Yes. It tells me that some native English speakers do not fully understand and are not able to produce university level discourse. This cannot be a complete surprise, surely..?  In the writing section,  accuracy is not the only criterion - most non-academic native writing would do less well due to lack of grammatical range, inappropriate vocabulary, and poor structure.    For what it's worth, I state explicitly that band 7 - a grade that will get you into most universities in the UK - is on the way to a 2. ;This, pretty much, given the context.;"

I'm aware of three carrying the religious significance of the father, son and the holy ghost and having other unique ""properties"" in   magical and mathematical context, but I, too, am curious about the number's role in storytelling. So much in these fairy tales occurs in threes, that it leads me to wonder if there is something inherently more satisfying for the storyteller and reader when something is not once, not twice, but three times. Do we just prefer the rhythm it creates? Very curious.;I see what you're saying, Marla, and I suppose that's true, but what has really struck me isn't just that 3 is a popular number for characters, but it is also predominately the number of times an action is repeated or an event occurs. Almost as if an event only happened once, it wouldn't be significant; twice could be a coincidence; four times is overkill     but 3! That's the perfect number to convey significance.;Martha, that is great insight! Really helpful. That makes excellent sense to me and helps explain why we would intuitively find patterns of three more interesting than others. Great stuff!;I've been struck by the number of stories that involve the characters finding a lonely, often abandoned house in the deep, dark woods where they are able to find refuge and respite. Often, the characters are fleeing danger in the ""real"" world outside the woods. ""The 12 Brothers"" is an example. ""Snow White"" is another. Inevitably, the outside world finds them and their peaceful existence is disrupted.The exception seems to be ""Hansel and Grethel"" where the house appears to offer them relief from their hunger but is really just a sweet trap.;I know this is last minute, but that's how I do things, I suppose. I'm still knocking around in my head which essay theme to pursue and it occurred to me that many, many of these tales hinge on a barter that goes bad in some fashion. Sometimes, it's a trade in which one of the characters clearly gets the upper hand; other times, the swap is a chance for the reader to laugh at the poor trading skills of a character; and then there are the cheats who somehow squelch on a trade.It'd be safe to say that bartering and trading were essential and commonplace back when these stories were popular, wouldn't it?;Professor Rabkin knows more than I do probably on almost anything, but after hearing his lecture on ""Hansel and Grethel,"" I have to cry foul to his use of back story. His foundation for arguing that Grethel had an illicit desire to kill and supplant her mother is shaky at best. More than that, though, the back story angle is out of bounds, I think. Should I be able to add back story to any character in a story in order to buttress my argument? It would certainly make things easier at times. It's not using the text to make your case and it seems like an illegitimate move to me.;I understand the Freudian critique and while I'm not sold on it, I won't argue its legitimacy as an analysis technique. But the back story bit? I don't know. That seems to me a stretch too far beyond the text.;Well, that's true, every story does have an implicit or explicit backstory. I think extrapolating backward, however, wades too far into speculative waters and the farther back you go the deeper it gets. You seem up to speed on this sort of thing, Greg.

Regardless, I remembered this other tale called Hans in Luck, in which the main character Hans is a servant and described as being a person of much luck.What I found in common between this tale and the one you mentioned, is that luck is an attribute that makes the character different from all the rest and that will help them succeed in the story (although in Hans case it seems like an ironic kind of Luck), almost like a skill. When it comes to princes and king's sons, on the other hand, they are never described as being lucky, it is just implicit in the story. If the hero of the tale is a prince you know things will be okay just because he showed up. Even when the prince is put in danger, something will happen that will lead him to a happy ending. On the other hand, if the hero is a low born, be him lucky, smart, strong... you will have to keep reading to know what he will do to overcome his difficulties.In the end, I think the big difference is when the hero is high born you'll learn what happened to him, while when the hero is low born you'll learn what he had to do.Does this sound coherent at all?  ;Hi Theo, I appreciate your response, and I do see what you say, but fantasy in general provides that escape from the known usual, and yet deviating this much from causality is not at all accepted in other fantasy sub-genres.

You can pass the course with a minimum of six essays, if they are good enough.;Sublimation - it's a good thing. And Carroll put the sublime in sublimation.;I think the resistance to looking this with regard to Carroll - or should I say, Dodgson - is the huge importance of the story of that boat ride in which Wonderland was conceived (so to speak). In a way, that ""golden afternoon, full leisurely we glide"", *is* the story of Alice in Wonderland.Was Dodgson 'into' little girls? In a way, he invented little girls, and I suspect the lectures in this unit will look at how childhood itself is invented.And I'm not surprised few people want to mess with that.I think my new favourite concept, 'atavism' is at play here. We're surrounded now by talk of paedophilia, and media sexualisation of childhood, yet we are loathe to draw a line from those, back through Shirley Temple, to Dodgson, the ""lover of children"" at the dawn of photography.By the way, interesting euphemism, that - paedophile. Like it's some kind of sexual orientation. I prefer 'child molester' and 'child rapist' in cases where those apply.Dodgson was certainly an aesthetic lover of children (except boys). It's difficult to clear-headedly examine the connections (or not) between aestheticism, eroticism, sexualisation, objectification, and abuse. We know aestheticism can go horribly wrong - that doesn't mean it went terribly wrong in this case. It does sound like the parents of the children were right to be wary.;I guess I've added one problematic term to another by bringing in 'sexual orientation'!But on 'paedophilia', I don't know how it is where you are, but here in New Zealand we commonly hear the phrase 'convicted paedophile' in the news. The important distinction you have made has been lost, if it was ever there, in the 'public imagination' (if there is such a thing).   To that picture add frequent news of internet child pornograohy.All of these probably are more hindrances than help in understanding Dodgson/Carroll. ""Paedophile"" has become one of those conversational bombs like ""terrorist"" (I'd be interested to know which is used more frequently).Perhaps better talk of experiencing attraction to children. And, for better or for worse, if Dodgson had not been attracted to girls to a degree most would be uncomfortable with, he would not have created this character that has attracted millions of readers and collectors over nearly 150 years now.;"

Eating a nut isn't enough to deserve death, (We've all snuck an extra cookie sometime, haven't we?) but to starving medieval peasants, eating more than your share and depriving others of their food would seem like a pretty bad thing to do. I'd also like to add that the story also deals with the horrors of living in an untrustworthy community.  The other creatures basically let the cock's wife die, but the cock  still has to rely on them to help him bury her. Even if the burial had  gone completely smoothly, the trauma of relying on people who let his  wife choke to death would've been really humiliating for him.Remember that medieval villages were really isolated. Because of heavy forests and lack of roads or law enforcement, travel was really dangerous. A village 15 miles away could have a completely different dialect from yours so you wouldn't completely understand what they were saying. Villagers were basically stuck in the community they were born in, even if the community was horrible, like the cock's, so a story like ""Death of the Hen"" would've rung true to them. So while I don't think ""Death of the Hen"" has a moral in the Aesop fable sense, it has experiences that reflect the dark-age culture it came from.;How would you compare the fairy tales the Grimm brothers compiled to the fairy tales Hans Christian Anderson wrote? They're obviously from different national backgrounds (the Grimm brothers were German, Anderson was Danish). Anderson's most famous stories (Snow Queen, Little Mermaid, Match Girl) were originally written by him, while the Grimm Brothers mainly compiled stories from foreign countries and feudal history. I personally feel that the Grimm tales are more focused on power struggles and survival, while the Anderson tales are more focused on personal loneliness.  The Grimm tales are filled with cannibalistic witches, contests of strength, and abandoned orphans trying not to starve. Since these stories were told and passed down from the dark ages through famines, wars, and unstable governments, it makes sense they'd focus on protagonists trying to fight nature and build good lives for themselves.  The Anderson tales, on the other hand, seem to be more about the pain of trying to ""reach"" other people, like the Steadfast Soldier pining after the ballerina, or the sister in the ""Snow Queen"" who tries to save her brother after he loses the ability to perceive beauty. Sometimes the protagonist's loneliness is even attached to a surivival element, like the Little Mermaid who'll never go to heaven unless a human falls in love with her. Anderson's original tales were written in the 19th-century, when day-to-day surivival was easier and Europe was exploring Romantic ideas, so it makes sense his stories would be more about connecting with people in the society around you. Basically, I think the Grimm tales are more about surviving literal death. while the Anderson tales suggest that not being able to connect with others is like a kind of death itself. What do you guys think? Agree or disagree? I hope we can have more in-depth discussions in these forums, so I want to spark a conversation! :) ;Thank you, Melissa. I did mention that the Grimm's tales were compiled from tales ""told and passed down through the dark ages,"" but I feel like I could've put more emphasis are their collective, oral nature in my post. Thanks for pointing that out. That being said, I do feel that Andersen's tales are about more than just his own experiences. They might have stemmed from his personal loneliness and love lives, but for them to have become as popular as they did, something about them must have captured the minds of 19th-century European society as a whole. Consider the boy in the ""Snow Queen"": When the Snow Queen brainwashes the boy and spirits him away, he's only able to think of the world in numbers and equations. It reflects the common Romantic-era sentiment of math and science ""corrupting"" the pure. Andersen might have had a more personal hand in his tales than the Grimm's (and some of his tales were still passed down/influenced by nurses and tutors), but I think in the end they too ""widely reflect the concerns of a whole culture,"" just like the Grimm's.;"

I'll post my essay next week.;Hello ! I've managed to copy my interpretation of ""The Death of the Hen"" here it isAll Grimm stories, however fanciful, follow a clear logic, except one which seems quite nonsensical :    The Death of the Hen   . We might be tempted to dismiss it as meaningless, unless we understand it as the representation of a dream.             The story starts with the cause of the choking of the hen, her greed which makes her break her promise to share the nut with the cock. However, the moral of the story is not, as in most tales, made explicit. One does not draw conclusions in dreams...             The second scene is the quest for water by the cock, in a vain attempt to save the hen. It is centered on a bride, who has to provide him with scarlet silk, which could be the proof of her virginity before marriage, in exchange for her lost garland, which may refer to her being unfaithful. The    unfaithfulness    of the hen is developed here. We can also observe that the cock's quest is frantic : there is a strong sense of urgency which is constantly impeded, until the cock succeeds in getting water, but too late. The feeling of being obstructed in one's movement is a very common feature of   dreams.             The last scene is the hen's funeral. All the animals attend the funeral, and all die while trying to cross the river, without any explanation concerning their death. Even a burning piece of coal, symbol of the warmth of life, is extinguished. No one can pass that river but the cock, whose love for the hen allows him to overcome all obstacles, until he dies of grief, his faithfulness contrasting the hen's betrayal.             Stretching the interpretation of the story further, we may think of it as the dream of a man whose wife is unfaithful. He unconsciously wants her dead, while knowing that her death would be the end of his world, and the end of himself;"

Narrative can be viewed broadly in two ways - What the writers probably meant, and the reader's interpretation.From a brief background read-up on the Grimm Fairytales, I understood that the stories were meant to aid the efforts of Romanticism and build a national identity for Germany by representing German culture and folklore in a way that was accessible to everyone, including children. From this, we can assume allusions to German culture - such as the use of cabbage in The Rabbit's Bride (just an example- cabbage is an important ingredient in German cuisine, and stealing that made the rabbit a symbol of the forces that were directly or indirectly attacking a significant part of the local culture)- however random it may seem.As for the subjective perspective, I think we are all free to interpret the stories the way we want to, which opens up a lot of opportunity for creativity. In Death of a Hen, for instance, you could derive the moral that one small selfish act(not sharing   nut) could have more far reaching effects than one can imagine (everyone ends up dying).;I don't think the readings should make us uncomfortable if we are, within ourselves, and with each other, honest about the fact that all of this is just an objective study of subjective literature. Racism, sexism and discrimination are all just part of the narrative. We don't personally attach ourselves to any of those things while studying the works, so don't worry about it too much :);Of course! It would kill literature to treat it entirely objectively, but a degree of detachment could help is deal with the discomfort, I suppose :)  ;When I was a kid, I read Walt Disney's version of the fairytales before I read the Grimm's version. And the difference is striking.  I remember being more drawn to the happy endings and pretty illustrations in Disney books, and more averse to the revenge and darkness and eerie illustrations in Grimms' books.  For a child reader, and especially on like me, for whom English is a second language, fairytales were something you use to entertain yourself with and learn language from. So, happy stories were perfectly fine.  But as we grow older, and see more evil in the world, I think we become paranoid and cautious and begin to think that exposure to dark things better equips you to face the big bad evil world. This is why people like  Bettelheim and the Grimms find it necessary to reflect on and symbolically represent the negative side of reality in children's literature.I personally, however, don't think it necessary to introduce the dark element to children, because doing that never helped me deal with my fears. In fact, I think a lot of my fears as a child were born from the creepy imagery put in my mind by the idea of evil witches and revenge and torture.  ;I agree! :) For me as a child, Grimm's tales were just evil and unpleasant.

The use of animals as a hack technique is to engage the imagination. It's a technique of entertainment, as in 'holding the attention', not because there is any inherent deeper meaning or symbolism; other that what the reader derives. It is a thing of wonder. In the spirit of which, it seems to say, 'conform', 'do not indulge in relationships outside of your type (class)'. It didn't stop the rabbit, who probably needed some comfort cabbage asap.

However, the feeling I get from the story is that it's really about the maiden. The mother and the rabbit are both figures in relation to her.  First she is told what to do by her mother, to send him away. He shows sexual interest in her ""ride on my tail..."", and she refuses the first couple times, because her mother is warning against it. But the third time she gives in and goes with him. The cabbage patch represents her fertility and her innocence, and living in a house with her mother represents being isolated and innocent. He comes to take away her innocence, and her mother warns her to send him away. When she doesn't heed her mother, and is seduced by him, he immediately begins bossing her around, and tells her to cook the cabbage for their guests, which seems a bit like exploitation and putting her on display. She feels lonely and realizes that she shouldn't have given in to the sexual temptation because this rabbit isn't that nice of a guy. She realizes her mistake, and returns home to her mother where she will be protected.  I think it is about rebellion and growing up, as well. She doesn't WANT to be isolated and obedient to her mother forever. She just finds out nearly too late that she will just end up being a slave to the rabbit instead.  ;I don't think she left for no reason, or just because she's gullible and non-assertive. When you read the story, everything she does in the entire first part is based on doing her mother's bidding. This rabbit gives her an opportunity to rebel from her mother and leave home. Perhaps she is curious what he can offer her that her mother can't.   I think Abigail is onto something.But she traded one sort of submissiveness for another. She went from being an obedient daughter to becoming an obedient bride, and she realized that leaving wasn't all it was cracked up to be.  ;Leslie, I think the ""sit on my tail"" DEFINITELY has sexual connotation. The way I read it, was that rather than having no choice but to go with him because he deflowered her, is that he basically led her into sexual temptation; he seduced her. The first two times she said no, but the third time she gave in. She went with him, was ""deflowered"" but did not want to be trapped into the marriage. She had made a mistake.  I thought it was interesting that there was no father figure as well. Perhaps it is to focus on the fact that the male figure in this story is the rabbit who wants her as his bride, in contrast to the protective, female mother figure.  ;"

I've thought about this emphasis on red in these stories regarding greediness and gluttony, their effects crippling relationships and causing tragedy, and am struggling to see why it is significant.  In any case, the stories up to this, The Death of the Hen,  have been, in my opinion, centred around greed and wealth. The greedy causing tragedy (The Death of the Hen), tarnishing relations  (Clever Grethel), being usurped (Six Soldiers of Fortune) and forcing marriage under violence (The Rabbit's Bride). They each show figures of authority - a cock, a king, a master, a bridegroom - and agreements which are undermined - sharing food, cooking food for guests, giving a fair pay, suitable marriage (not necessarily agreed upon, but believed to be so by the rabbit) - and I believe it is a message to authorities. The message is thus: Those who act in a way unjust meet their end soon enough or ruin everything they held dear. The people do not stand for usurpers and will find ways to rebel, like the six soldiers or the rabbit's bride.

Although, this didn't particularly turn out too well for him in the end.Although the hen was originally at fault for breaking the deal and deceiving the cock, perhaps he believed that this was no reason for her to die, so he set out on a quest to retreive water for her. He did everything he was asked of, without question, so that he could brink water for the hen and save her.  The latter part of the story reminds me of a song from the Wicked soundtrack: ""No Good Deed Goes Unpunished"". This is because the straw and the coal offered to help, but eventually doomed themselves, and the animals they were trying to help. Only the stone was effective in getting them across, so maybe this is a lesson in that one must have a strong base in order to get through tough times.  My take on the story is that the cock is a devoted man, whereas the hen is a dishonest woman. Their relationship falls apart because the woman cheats the man, and everyone dies (but maybe the fact everyone died a sad death is an exaggeration on being loyal to someone who is not loyal to you).Or I could be speaking gibberish.

BLERGH! On the bright side, that gives me an opportunity to post my thoughts here, and I'm not limited to a measly 320 words. On the other hand, I've already watched the post-reading lectures, and have therefore taken on the ""taint"" (using the term loosely) of the professor's   analysis.Professor Rabkin has certainly made many very astute observations and has, with the help of established research, provided us with a thorough analysis of the works of the Grimm Bros as a whole and in detail. He has provided us with the Male, Modern, Urban, Christian, Western view of this collection, or rather, compilation and subsequent re-write of these tales.I come at this from the viewpoint of Female, Anachronistic, Pagan, and neither western nor eastern, perhaps a more Indigenous (in the sense of ""connected to the older ways, or to nature"") way of looking at things.Taking into full account the aspects pointed out by Professor Rabkin, i.e. the underlying nationalistic agenda, the rampant sexism and intentional archetypal programming of gender roles, societal behaviors, religious views and prejudices, I'd like to call your attention to a couple of other things I've noticed or have had pointed out to me over the years by friends and mentors.As much as bread and wine are the nourishment of the Christian sacrament, milk,   honey, grain and meat are the proper foods for the Gods for many northern European and Celtic Pantheons. These Pantheons include strange beings, often referred to as ""Faerie"" or ""Elves"" ""Albs"" (btw, an alternative etymology of Albion, or the names Alban/Albert and similar, is Alfar, or Elf, ""Albion"", therefore, could also be construed as the land of the Elves).   While, to most of us, in the context of the modern world, such beings, be they demi gods, nature spirits or denizens of a frightful night, will seem unreal, and one's insistence on their existence will meet with anything from friendly ridicule to accusations of insanity, at the time the stories were published in their written formDISbelief in these beings was just as much considered an insanity.Now, these tales were laid down at a time when, despite the efforts of the Inquisition, a couple of centuries before, some people still remembered, taught and studied these older forms of knowledge. At a time when there wasn't a central, proscribed and conveniently censored curriculum for the majority of young students, these tales provided yet one more way to discredit the old ways, by portraying the wise crones as evil witches, the young and pretty airheads as the winners, often by defying or overcoming their ill portrayed elders. Cleverly, the writers left just enough small bits of the old knowledge in these stories to make them seem credible; i.e. who, at that time, DIDN't know that woman's moon blood is one of the most powerful magic substances a human could get her hands on? While making most traditional magic the tools of the opponent and therefore programming society into thinking that the tools themselves were evil, the Grimms furthered the cause of the Christian faith to disregard and revile views and beliefs that went against their patriarchial agenda. Incidentally, generations upon generations of women were programmed into domestic docility, rejection of their bodies, intuitions and innate skills, often at the cost of our, admittedly different, but sharp intellect. At the same time, men were programmed into thinking of women as inferior, therefore not worth listening to in all matters of advice, or as readily exploitable, since women were ""worth less"". Maidens (daughters) were programmed into disregarding the wisdom and advice of their elders, those barren witches (oh, yea, while you're at it, look up the etymology of ""witch"", and, if you think I;m WEIRD,... do yourself a favor,... look that word up too :-) )Now we are left with a MESS. Several generations of alienating ourselves not only from nature, due to the loss of society's knowledge of every natural life and thing as a fellow being, but also several generations worth of deeply subconsciously ingrained behavioral patterns that are counter to natural balance but are presented to us from day one,.. gender oriented clothing, the difference in toys, books or acceptable activities, etc etc. The disregard of one gender for another and vice versa, the outright prejudice against other cultures or deviants within our own are well established behavioral patterns due to our early programming, when the pathways in the brain are still malleable.   We have, to a large extent exported this buggy program   to other cultures accross the globe. The Brothers Grimm have done a marvelous job, Now, how do we undo it? Responsibly? Without putting something similarly faulty in its place?;"

Maybe the threes are not just to help us remember and interact, but to warn people early on that something important was coming?

He says about himself: ""I would rather have something living than all the treasures of the world"". At that point he is in total contrast to the king, who is simply interested in gold.  The first time, the king sees all the gold, he is astonished: So he never thought it being possible to the miller's daughter spinning gold out of straw. This may implicate two meanings: Either he does not care at all about a human life or he plays a quite cruel play to the miller's daughter in threatening her with death, maybe to force her to admit the truth: that she is not capable of spinning gold out of straw.Rumpelstiltskin gets the necklace and the ring. Maybe he takes a burden from the miller's daughter(?):The necklace may stand for being chained to someone or something, the ring as a visible sign of being engaged. He allows her extra time to think of his name. Does he act so because he underestimates the miller's daughter's ability? (like the king never thought of her spinning ability?) Why does he not fear the possibility, that she may tell the king? He puts himself into danger at that point. Does he know that the miller's daughter and meanwhile Queen will not tell her husband the truth? That she will more likely risk to lose her child?The Miller's daughter does not try to defend herself in front of the king. Why does she not speak for herself and tell the truth? Why does she think: ""But who knows whether that will happen?""   Does she not take for serious her situation?   Rumpelstiltskin at last cries: ""The devil told you that!"" How may we understand this? The devil is the only one, who knows Rumpelstiltskin's name? Or that, like Faust, she does not hesitate to beg the devil's support? (Do you know the Lilith-Myth in the Talmud? Lilith was Adam's first wife. She was equal to him and not willing to get into submission. She knew God's secret name. When God in Adam's demand tries to force her to be submissive to Adam   and him, she cries out loud his name and therefore gets banned from paradise into desert.) So in the Christian-Jewish tradition there is a secret around God's name. In the end the Miller's daughter becomes a very powerful Queen. She ascends socially and her child stays with her!   Hope you find my thoughts on Rumpelstiltskin interesting!;It's really fine, that you liked my comment.I watched somewhat closely to the brewing and baking thing. In a German encyclopedia   ""Bier-Lexikon"" I found an article about the brewing origin (title: Einst war das Brauen Frauensache - which means: There was a time when Brewing was a femals business). Very famous was the Holy Hildegard of Bingen for her universal knowledge and one of her skills was the knowledge about beer brewery. But you may go back in history even to the old Germanic People: in these times the women brewed the beer.Going back to the Brothers Grimm: they were part of the Romanticism movement in Germany at that time. They wanted to create a new intellectual world, referring to their german origins. The Romanticists were idealistic, highly sensitive intellectuals, poetrists, philosophers, scientists, artists and musiciens of all kinds. They came together in so called ""Literarische Salons / Jour fixe"", which, by the way quite often were arranged by sophisticated young women like Rahel Levin Varnhagen, Henriette Herzberg or Dorothea Schlegel   discussing their philosophical, aesthetical or social ideas.In these movement quite a lot of famous women became writers (Caroline von G _nderode, Madame de Stael [who was a french artist], Bettina von Arnim). Here   a new intellectual world opened its windows to women and men. This was quite new!;I read your post and felt really touched . I had a time, when I was not able to read any kind of literature without detecting racists, mysogyne or else discriminating implications. I gave up reading for a while.  Than I started to search for those hidden traces of female or else subversive, fragmented culture or discourse. What I think is really important is to find reflections on your own feelings, abilities, desires, confessions or maybe prejudices?! This is, what reading and reflection on myths and motives in literature really means to me.During the last summer I read some of John Irvings novels. I don't know, whether or not Irving is a persona non grata in the American literature scene, but I really liked his openmindedness to personal concepts. I found, which is really quite rare among male writers, that he loves his female protagonists, he loves all kind of bodies, especially the imperfect ones. The most intact, sane persons in his novels are those, who are female and male attributed characters, the closer to 100 %female or male they come, the more rude or stupid or simply disgusting are theyThink of that and be at ease with yourself. You are who you are. We are all in different ways disabled, imperfect, not mainstream, not fitting in those aesthetic, social or gender common places.

Thank you for your insights.Andrea;Megan,Thank you for your short ""book review"": I will keep it in mind, since it sounds/reads really interesting!;It's not necessesarily obedience and/or beauty which leads to the ""happy end""! Look at the princess in  ""Frog Prince"": she breaks the curse in being disobedient and rejecting the inappropriate, even disgusting demands of the frog (and her father!).   The step-mother in ""Snow-White"" is beautiful, but she needs to be the most beautiful of all. Her envy and recklessness, her life-threatening attitude towards Snow-White leads to her terrible death. Snow-White is the most beautiful of all, but she is arrested in a quasi death status from the very beginning. She, not unlike her step-mother, lets herself over to seduction of pretty things. Finally she becomes a ""beautiful jewel in a tresor of glas"", really beautiful to look at and placed on the top of a mountain, so that everybody may see her! Spitting out the treacherous, seductive apple is the healing (with which she has been fed by her step-mother).;I really appreciate the article you posted here, because it refers to a variety of gender aspects discussed in this forum. One of my favourite questions is this: ""Why did we lose all those male counterparts to Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, and the girl who becomes the wife of the Frog King?""My simple answer would be: Because the boys, when they came of age, entered the real, challenging world: They went abroad, journeyed to foreign countries in the trading business, as students or (most exciting) as explorers like Georg Forster or Alexander von Humboldt, they became independent. Whereas the young, well educated, intelligent women stayed at home, in the golden ""bird-cage"" of their fathers or husbands. Where could they travel else than in their fantasy? Why should they tell stories about dragons and ogres and female knights? They wanted to be powerful queens. They wanted to be admired and loved: because if they were not in reality, can you imagine such a life of tristess?The Grimms collected ""their"" fairy tales in a quite comfortable, completely unmagical way: they found female narrators in befriended families: these pretty, sophisticated, intelligent women. Than, because the female versions were at times quite slippery and too obviously connotated with female (especially sexual) needs, they overworked them, made them attractive to a possibly male, quite more often to an audience of children.

A lot of them   (and maybe those who became the most famous ones) were of French origin. First the Grimms did not know themselves. When they knew about it, they kept silent, because they wanted to work on a real German folkloristic collection. Of course in a sense they made them their own: because they overworked them.I was astonished myself when reading these Articles!;As I am mother of two girls (12 and 10 years old) I have a perspective from both sides:   as the story-teller of bedtime stories to my girls and as a former child listener to these stories.Yesterday we (girls and I) talked about the Grimm fairy tales and it turns out that they both have different favorite ones. The older one loved the seven raven; she was really scared about Hansel and Gretel, especially about the witch. The younger one loved Rapunzel and Sleeping beauty (Dornr  schen) and The Goose-Girl.   Both found their way to understand the tales and ignore those parts, they were scared of or which they didn't really understand. When they were very small I ""censored"" the stories, where they were extremely punishing to the vicious step-mothers. My younger daughter yesterday evening begged me to read Sleeping beauty and Snow-White to her. She had a good night's sleep afterwards!I myself, when I was a child,   loved the Grimm tales: My favorite tales were Hansel and Gretel and The Beauty and the Beast (which was no Grimm tale but a French one). Of course I enjoyed a lot of other fairy tales too, but these were my favorites.The ""In"" and ""Out"" as you put it is most certainly sexually connoted. During my reading of the Household stories for this course I stumbled over some interesting sources in a German magazine, Die Zeit online. It is said there, that the Grimm brothers collected a great deal of their tales from young, well educated women. The fairy tales often were so obviously sexually inclined, that they overworked them to make them more ""children-compatible"". You may read my other posts on this theme under the post ""Dealing with Bigotry"" and ""Representation of women in Grimm's Fairy Tales"".;Did you use other interpretations, texts, literature sources to underline your thesis and your thoughts?

I've met characters that made me laugh out loud, others that made me cry, some that I fell in love with and even dreamed of. Some that made me fear of falling asleep and others that left me with a disgusting feeling, hating the world. I don't believe that every character is a part of the author.

FALSE,St563,Coh2,1,0,0,2,13.4662,0.14852,2,0,2,0.001946788,0,"Sexton's RapunzelEveryone in this forum might enjoy Anne Sexton's revision of the Rapunzel tale in her collection Transformations, in which Sexton offers her verse-versions of the tales. She take themes from the originals and lets them play out. In the case of Rapunzel, the witch more explicitly exhibits sexual desire for the young Rapunzel, wanting to possess her in every way but also needing to hide away to do this triply transgressive thing (bondage, rape, homosexuality). Sexton explores the darker underpinnings suggested by the tales but also delights in that darkness. When the prince arrives to seduce Rapunzel, it is as if the whole of ""normal"" society has reasserted itself to rescue her from the witch's depravity. But the tone is hilariously light: he ""dazzles her with his dancing stick."" In the Lucy Crane version, apart from the use of the word ""wife"" that follows right on the heels of the prince's visit, there is also a tantalizing detail a couple of lines later when we learn that the witch and the prince trade off seeing Rapunzel during the night and day (though the witch doesn't realize this at first). Rapunzel is poised between traditional socio-sexual norms and the opposite. But, crucially, she seems to choose the prince (whereas she gave not consent to her bondage by the witch, clearly). As a way of reinforcing Judeo-Christian norms, the Grimm tales are not afraid to evoke fear and loathing.;The Freudian analysis (which I suspect we'll encounter throughout the class, given Prof. Rabkin's proclivity) is certainly not the only reading; it's one among many, and some may object to it vociferously (if I can ""say"" that online). I, for one, found it a stretch in Hansel and Gretel. Given that many of the originators of these tales were spinning women, I can imagine a very different set of intentions animating those characters. As far as the back story goes, of course we invent back stories and futures for our characters, or we're tempted to do so. From early childhood, we've wondered ""and then what happened?"" BUT, when you invent a back story, whether you're a professor or not, you are inventing, and you have to offer the kind of support that will make that invention compelling and/or convincing. In the case of Hansel and Gretel, I find it odd to give the father any kind of central position. He's utterly emasculated, and I can't see why we should read him as the ultimate desire of Gretel. Also, I think Prof. Rabkin gives Hansel short shrift when he argues that Hansel is basically a minor character who enables the females to duke it out. He exhibits cleverness and resourcefulness, if a lack of foresight with the crumb thing. In fact, he is a primary agent of their survival, whereas Gretel is the agent of revenge.   Rabkin needs Hansel to be minor because  he needs the ""crumbs-are-feminine"" thesis in order to support his larger reading across several tales.   Instead of the Freudian reading, I think the story reflects the importance of food for sustenance, the terrible things that the hungry might do for food, and the breakdown of the traditional family when the father can't keep his family happy, safe and well-fed (as we've seen, the tales reinforce a traditional  Patriarchal social model, and when that falls apart, bad things happen...women in control of families do bad things).  The gingerbread house is odviously another added bonus: to warn children away from excessive sweet consumption. The step-mother and witch  are two sides of the same coin (one won't feed them; one wants to eat them)--they are both associated with the corruption of love (food), not so much with procreation (except as that follows from food...which is less compelling, though it is Rabkin's argument). There's a lot more to be said, but I've got to go...suffice it to say that we don't have to accept the Freudian reading as authoritative, just interesting (and compelling for some).;"

I see Cinderella ('Ashenputtel') as less about the significance of her beauty but more the significance of her industriousness - as we also see in 'Mother Hudda'. I agree that the physical representation is used as an indicator of the behavioral attributes, particularly in accompanying illustrations and film representations, but really Cinderella's transformation is in terms of outcomes rather than her clothes. Maybe I'm misrepresenting your perspective, but I don't think that the Grimm brothers were motivated to produce content for popularity's sake! Whilst they were attempting to collate 'volks tales' which had a universality, there is an undertone of morality, and especially around 'staying in one's place.' This is true across the Grimm collection, in cases where the nobility / royalty are the protagonists (as in 'Sleeping Beauty') as much as peasants ('Hansel and Gretel'). In a most fundamental sense, as these stories outline basic human needs (food, sex, desire for power and money) and the conflict that arises from an imbalance in relationships around these, they remain timeless and their themes continue to resonate. ;"

I remember thinking to myself, ""I want to read a book to him."" Ever since I could remember, I've always had a book on the go, and it feels wrong not to, as if I'm denying my own nature. I can't imagine my life without the joy of the written word in it. I'm curious how everyone got their start with reading as a hobby. Was it a family member that got you into it? A friend? A teacher?   Were you just curious and picked one up yourself? Or do you not care for it as much, and only read what's required? I would love to hear your opinion on the matter!;"

Those older stories can in turn be traced back to even older stories, which were likely taken across with different migrations of people and language over a long period of time. It's my understanding that there's an awful lot of conjecture about the Indo-European precursers (Linear A and Linear B I think) which means that these story elements are similarly best-guess theories. That being said, there was a lot of trade along the Silk Road since at least the Roman times, and stories would have been exchanged forwards and backwards over that period. With humerous mistranslations, one imagines. ;)I'd love to find out if there are any story motifs which are shared with the Aborigine peoples in Australia, because they're the oldest continuous lineage of people and story that we know of. Although the Amerindian tribal heritage would show a lot as well, because again they were isolated for a long time.My guess is that there'll be loads of things which are culture-specific, like ... seven swans, or golden fruit; but there will be more general ideas, like rewarding innate nobility and punishing the selfish, which are more universal. Whether that's from our pre-literate ancestors before they migrated everywhere, or because most surviving cultures have similar attitudes towards rewards and punishments, is not something I want to make a guess about.;I didn't realise how much cleverness was rewarded, even when the person being clever was committing criminal acts.

He also looks at other things such as tricksters that see to be fairly ubiquitous, the aboriginal one taking the form of a crow.  I also remember seeing some footage once of Pete Seeger discussing how the same tunes are sometimes found in the folk music of different cultures.

The following is what I wrote for my essay   to give me a bit of back-up for this silly idea. Let me know what you think!Lewis Caroll is the author of whimsical, imaginative, and incredible tales.  Alice's Adventures in Wonderland  is a tale of a world gone mad. While Alice is quite rational in the real world, I argue that she is quite mad in the context of Wonderland.Within the novel, Alice seems to be confused about what and who she is. When she encounters the mother pigeon in the woods, she tries to explain what she is. She sputters, ""'But I'm NOT a serpent, I tell you! [...] I-I'm a little girl,' said Alice, rather doubtfully"". (Caroll, Location 385) Almost every encounter she has makes her question her beliefs in the order of the world. By the time she reaches the Caterpillar, she can only tell him, ""'I-I hardly know [who I am], sir, just at present--at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then'"". (Caroll, Location 320)The Cheshire Cat is the one who really points out what kind of fantastic and nonsensical place Wonderland is. When they meet, the Cheshire Cat says, ""'We're all mad here. I'm mad. You're mad. [...] You must be,' said the Cat, 'or you wouldn't have come here'"". (Caroll, Location 480)It is quite obvious that she is unable to understand even the simplest things, such as words, in Wonderland. When she asks the Mouse to tell his story, he says ""'Mine is a long and sad tale!' said the Mouse [...] 'It IS a long tail, certainly,' said Alice, looking down with wonder at the Mouse's tail; 'but why do you call it sad?'"". (Caroll, Location 200)Alice enters Wonderland with a fixed sense of the order of the world. Her core beliefs are challenged at every turn, and she questions who she is throughout the entire piece. Wonderland is ruled by nonsense, and her normal bahavior does not fit in, causing her to become mad within that environment.;Alice never questions what her name is, but she is constantly questioning who she is throughout the novel. As she makes her journey, she encounters many rude and curious creatures and situations. Although she is in a world of nonsense, she reacts to many things with logic and rationality--which, in Wonderland, is actually madness because everything is topsy-turvy.;"

I definitely sensed that in many instances he used the book as a way bash the New Woman movement, and near the end of the book it felt a little too forced how all of the men were going leaps and bounds to try to protect Mina from any kind of discomfort, even mild mental discomfort from the discussions of their daily vampire hunts.At the same time though, I think Stoker did do a good job in general of showing how men and women can compliment each other. The men were focused and determined, but Mina also reminded them of the truth that nobody else thought about--that Dracula too was a victim, that at one point he was a person turned sour like Lucy was. Mina also brought a different perspective to the notes and journals that they had was able to help them track down Dracula.While at times the characters in the book sometimes seemed a little harsh towards women's abilities in general, I wouldn't necessarily extrapolate this to Stoker's view of women in general. Stepping out of our cultural understanding for a moment and thinking about the culture in the book, this was considered normal. Something that has frustrated me about many pieces of historical fiction is the number of women who act outside of the societal norms for the time. It's just not very believable.;I absolutely loved this book. I was not overly thrilled at first to see that it was in the form diaries and letters, but I came to enjoy this style of writing as it made me feel more a part of the book and the characters.I do agree that for all their carefulness, there were a few times when the party was strangely ignorant, such as the bat and Mina's condition. The bat maybe I could see as them not taking notice, especially if they have no reason to believe that Dracula knows they're searching for him. I feel like Mina's condition should have been a little more obvious to them, especially so shortly after the ordeal with Lucy. Again, maybe I could let it slide that the possibility of Dracula's knowing and coming after them didn't cross their minds, but it was still kind of silly for them.Other than that though, I didn't really have any problems with the book. I really enjoyed the way it started too, focusing on Jonathan's journal while at Castle Dracula and then leaving you off to wonder if he died out there or made it out somewhere.;While I agree there's a lot of symbolism and parodies in Carroll's books... it could be he picked it just because.

After sunset and before sunrise, he can do whatever he wants in regard to his form. As for a limitation, I don't think Van Helsing ever said that Dracula  had  to sleep in his coffin during the day, but stated that if he was out after sunrise he would be unable to change form until night. So at Piccadilly, that means he would have been in his human form.I imagine that the reason he was attacking them was because he returned to Carafax to sleep, but found that his coffins had been sterilized, and so was now hurrying to his other coffin locations in spite of the daylight to make sure they were safe, rather than sleeping as he had planned.;"

He makes endless references to how much he wants to kiss the little girls, playfully  enumerating how many kisses he wants to give them.   That--combined with his statements about his love of the nudity of little girls--makes me question his intentions.   And though the book  doesn't contain many overt sexual references,   it makes many memorable references to food, which as Professor Rabkin has suggested, can sometimes be a stand-in for love, or sex.I'll admit that even after spending a year studying Carroll for my thesis, I'm still not comfortable coming to definitive conclusion about his desires--but I do wonder.;The standards of the day were complex.   In Victorian England, the age of consent was 12 until 1875, when it was raised to 13.   So while children  were treated as cherubs, they were also sexualized.And Dodgson  didn't like the nudity of all children.   He only liked the nudity of little girls.   In one letter her wrote: ""I confess I do not admire naked boys.   They always seem to me to need clothes   whereas one hardly sees why the lovely forms of girls should ever be covered up.""In another letter he was playful about requesting the nudity of his child-friends.   To a mother he wrote:""At any rate, I trust you will let me do some pictures of Janet naked; at her age, it seems almost absurd to even suggest any scruple about dress.My great hope, I confess, is about Ethel   _Do consider her case in reference to the fact that she herself is quite indifferent about dress.

Regardless of how the society of the time felt about it, a lot of them also thought that being left-handed was a sign of the devil and beat their children for it. It was still wrong - we know better.  ;From what I read, and my take after reading the book, Alice's Adventure in Wonderland is largely a story about growing up, and the struggle to retain and define an adult identity in a confusing and frequently nonsensical kind of world.  Throughout the story Alice changes size repeatedly, early on she has no choice but to do so (to get through the door), and later (in the rabbit's house) she drinks the bottle and changes size just ""because something interesting is bound to happen"", but these early changes tend to go awry and have discomfiting effects on her. Later though, after meeting the Caterpillar, she is finally able to return to her ""proper"" size, whereat she is most comfortable. Almost immediately afterwards, however, she uses the mushroom to adjust her size to match the March Hare's house, showing that she has gained some control over her changes, and is comfortable enough with herself to make those changes to accommodate others. It's a massive step forward for the little girl who cried so hard when she couldn't reach the key to get through the door.At the same time as these physical and psychological changes are occurring for Alice she goes through a number of different thought processes, such as her poignant question ""but if I've changed, then who am I?"" There are many quotations of this kind that follow Alice's development from scared and confused to confident and self-assured, though I haven't my notes with me to include them (all quotes above are also paraphrases, sorry).  ;It's probably not the greatest thing for you to take a no-compromise stance on, considering the easy availability of online dictionaries that could give you the word ""unintelligible"".  ;I'm glad someone else has raised this issue, because I felt a little uncomfortable broaching it. Of the 5 essays I marked, four of them were almost unreadable, the grammar and spelling was so bad. One of them was clearly a non-native speaker, for whom I had far more sympathy, and I did my best to evaluate all of them fairly, reserving comments on grammar and tone for the form section.  My concern is this: I'm a native speaker, with a BA in English, but live outside the US (and in fact in a non-English-speaking country). Is my location affecting the peers assignments I'm given? I could understand structuring a course so that people from similar geographic or demographic areas are lumped together, but if that is what's happening I'm going to be an outlier for my region.  ;Alice is trying to determine who she is, and trying to find a way to return to her ""proper size"", i.e a sense of self with which she is comfortable, in the face of all the demands Wonderland has of her to be another. Alice is still wary of changing, and tries to explain this to the caterpillar by suggesting that he will feel it queer when he changes into a chrysalis and then a butterfly.  The caterpillar rejects this and, what's more, doesn't see a need for him to explain who he is:  ""`I think, you ought to tell me who  YOU  are, first.'  `Why?' said the Caterpillar.""  Unlike Alice struggling to find her identity (proper size), the caterpillar embraces change, and rejects the need to explain or define himself for others. Finally, he gives Alice the tools necessary for her to change her size at will, which allows her at first to return to her ""proper size"", but then later to adjust her size according to the situation she finds herself in.;I think all literary works, in order to be successful, have to abide by their own set of internal laws. Even the most rigorous of realist fiction cannot follow precisely an exact replica of ""the laws of our physical universe"". In that regard he most certainly adheres to a very rigorous set of aesthetic laws which define the relationship between the writer and his audience.  Though things may happen to Alice seemingly at random, and the laws of physics twist and alter according to strange dream logic, yet Carroll is not free suddenly to change tack and start writing a murder-mystery novel. If you are asking whether he devised laws specifically to replace the conventional laws of physics (i.e if you cry a lot your tears will create a great lake of salty water) I would probably have to say no, but that's not to say hat the story doesn't progress along a logical (and indeed lawful) path, howsoever twisted that logic may be.  ;I agree with Cheri, the books are far too psychological, too internal, to translate easily into movies. I don't see why it shouldn't be possible to translate them into a different language though. Perhaps different languages might fare differently due to their inherent differences - I could see German working well, for instance, whereas those with entirely different structures or cultural backgrounds might interpret differently. As for the translations Anahita has read, well, maybe they're just bad translations.  ;You seem rather upset by this, and quite sure that your many quotations should have earned you ""at least a 5"", so let's take a closer look.  Overall, I agree with Peer 4. Your approach is certainly a worthwhile one, comparing the texts with some possible historical influences, but I'm afraid some grammar errors, odd sentence constructions, and opaque rather than concise writing makes your essay rather confusing.  In paragraph one, for example, in which you lay out your thesis, you make three statements:1.  The tale of  The Frog Prince  illustrates life during an age when class divisions were clearly defined. 2. The opening line    In the old times, when it was still of some use to wish for the thing one wanted    alludes to an innocent, heroic time in the past when status barriers were not so important. 3. Moreover, plot elements derived from mythology and the biblical account of David are incorporated to sustain the value of hope, as well as the elusive promise of deliverance.The first two statements are contradictory, and the third unrelated to them. Your use of the word ""moreover"" suggests to the casual reader that the following sentence will provide more evidence for the argument presented previously, but that is not the case.Para 2: ""Reminiscent  of"", if you please.  Para 3: ""However, distain is not so easily overcome."" I assume you meant ""disdain"", but even granting you that this sentence is neither supported by additional arguments, nor does it introduce or relate to the remainder of the paragraph. Also, I don't think you know what disdain means.  At the end of this paragraph you draw a comparison between the Princess and Odysseus's wife, Penelope. In the Odyssey, Penelope is alone at home, her husband presumed dead, while dozens of suitors invade her home, drinking her food, and trying to persuade her to marry them. She holds off the suitors by with constant delays until eventually her husband returns home to slaughter them. If this were parallel with the frog prince story Odysseus would return home only to be rejected by Penelope and cast away. Perhaps you could have compared the Frog Prince to Agamemnon, for whom that was exactly what happened.This inaccurate comparison continues through paragraph 4. Without better supporting evidence this comparison falls apart. It survived only so far as it did because you misrepresent at least one myth with which your peers were not familiar.  As for your conclusion, faithful servant characters occur in basically every body of literature, from Lord of the Rings to the Iliad, as well as a dozen Grimm tales. Pointing out that they reoccur here is no great insight, I'm afraid. Given all of this, your last sentence, ""It's possible to conclude then, that attitudes concerning designated sub-classes were revealing, and in hoping to overcome them, was oftentimes met with hostility, violence and grief"", is really hard to justify. It's also really hard to read.I'm sorry if all this seems harsh. It's because of the awful noise my irony meter has been making ever since I read the lines: ""P.S. I'm sure it didn't enrich your reading - you have to actually read something for that to happen."", and ""it's the sheer arrogance that annoys me"";I like your central idea here, that in the Grimm tales objects and comparisons can serve as an indication of growth, though it could certainly have been carried far deeper. Did you consider contrasting this idea with Lucky Hans, who slowly loses all his possessions?;I'm a little hesitant to post my assignment as I was a little late catching on to the rhythm of this course and suddenly realized at work that I had only 12 hours to turn something in. As a result the writing is rather poor and I was fairly horrified to find when I got it back that there were grammar errors. Nevertheless, I have commented on others essays here, and in the spirit of fair play I feel it only appropriate to allow them the same opportunity.My grade was 4 which, under the circumstances, is probably appropriate.  Words That BindInvocatory rhymes in the Brothers Grimm   s tales reveal the special power that spoken words have to transcend boundaries, reveal information, and compel the listener within and without the oral tradition of folk Germany.  The repetitive use of short, incantatory passages, such as,        ""Flounder, Flounder in the sea,              Hither, quickly come to me,              For my wife, dame Isabel,                Wishes what I scarce dare tell"" (The Fisherman and His Wife)performs the same mnemonic function as repetitive phrases in other works from oral tradition, such as ""Dawn with her rosy fingers"" (The Iliad), in that they are easy to remember, and provide a touchstone from which an oral story-teller can build. In the Brothers Grimm's tales they  also serve to bookmark and separate the story's different stages. The rhyming couplets given above are, in The Fisherman and His Wife, repeated six times, and every instance marks the beginning of a distinct stage in the story with a new set of demands, a new house for his wife,  and an increasingly [ed: grammar error repaired] agitated sea.Yet more than that, it seems to transcend the boundary between the worlds of the flounder and the fisherman, and to compel the flounder to appear before him and hear his wish. Boundaries are similarly transgressed in Rapunzel (""Rapunzel! Rapunzel!/Let down your hair!""), allowing the Prince (or the witch) entry into Rapunzel's tower sanctuary, and in ""The Almond Tree"", where the bird transcends death with his song to bring about the gory conclusion.In all instances these words seem to have a special power, both within the fantasy world of the tale and without. It is these phrases, after all, that best survive down through the centuries. Perhaps we, as readers, are comfortable granting these words such power within their own stories precisely because we recognize the very real power they have to transcend boundaries in the world without.Form Responses:peer 1      In general, this essay has good form. I would have just a couple minor quibbles. First, ""an increasibly agitated sea."" Do you mean ""increasingly""? Second, ""Yet more than that, it seems to transcend  _"" What is the ""it"" here? The repetitive use of invocatory phrases? You could make that a bit clearer to your reader.peer 2      Very good use of sentence structure, grammar, spelling and vocabulary. I particularly like the very direct and matter-of-fact style of writing you have adopted. Some of the longer sentences jarred slightly though, so it might be helpful to break them down into smaller sentences to make it easier on the reader.peer 3      The structure of this essay is clear and the use of a quotation from one of the tales gives to it a more appealing appearance and also adds to the essay rhythm. But even though the structure really helps to understand the message I think that the essay mixes two different ideas along the text: the repetition as a way to help the reader to follow the story and also the ""special"" power that those repetitions seem to have in the stories. I think that both of those interpretations of the repetitions would have been enough to build a whole essay on them. On the other hand if you wanted to put both of them in the same essay I think it would have been better and clearer to give to both of them the same presence in the text.Content Responses:peer 1      I most appreciate your attention to the idea that these passages ""transcend boundaries."" You could have perhaps limited yourself to just that point, and thereby had space to more thoroughly develop your three examples (flounder, Rapunzel, and Almond Tree). Given your opening sentence, I would have expected your essay to develop evidence that these passages transcend boundaries, reveal information, and compel listeners (within and without the tale). I'm not sure how much your paragraph that includes reference to the Iliad -- in which you point to the bookmarking and memorability of these passages -- contributes to your overall argument. I would have liked to see more development of your point about how the passages compel the listener outside the narrative of the story itself.peer 2      I very much like the way you've gone with this essay - I think focusing on the language used, rather than the symbology, was a very unique perspective and an interesting direction to take. You have presented the importance of the repetitions very persuasively. I am a little confused with the last sentence however; very real power they have to transcend boundaries in the world without. It would have been nice had you explained this a little further, perhaps given an example of how words such as this one have transcended boundaries outside of the stories themselves.peer 3      I really enjoyed your essay and the ideas you present in it. They way you created a relation between certain repetitions and how the stories move forward was really clear. Also the reference to the Illiad helps us remember that this narrative technique has been present since a really long time ago in many different works of art. But I think it would have been important to distinguish different uses of repetitions in the tales, for example, in one of the first tales in this collection, ""The Rabbit's Bride"", we have a repetition at the begining of the tale but the action doesn't change until the third repetition of a certain passage, there were no changes in the action or the characters after the previous two repetitions. For me, what would have made your essay a perfect one would have been to introduce that difference between the uses of the repetitions and then go for one of them and analyze it in detail.;And yet comments you shall have.  I'm sorry if you think the book is ""pure and utter madness"", because that's simply not the case. Irrationality and disorder are certainly strong themes in the book, but Alice herself is a fairly reasonable character struggling to adapt to a world full of incomprehensible practices, opaque rituals, and inscrutable characters. If you can't find some relevance to life in that, then I suspect you're not looking deep (or thinking wide) enough.  The books are  stuffed  with symbolism and imagery. If you're still having difficulty seeing that then pick up a copy of the book with an introductory essay and see what others have written about it.  ;And yet the locals live in fear of Dracula's castle, and it is Van Helsing's book learning that brings the creature to light and arms them to defeat it, freeing them all from the threat of the supernatural.;"

Lovecraft for essay writing and Doctorow for one of my Facebook posts.;I agree it is unfair that someone gave you a 1 based solely on grammar mistakes, however, you seem very resistant to the idea that you may need to improve your grammar.  I am an ESL teacher and I have seen this attitude a lot.  You seem to dismiss these grammar mistakes by saying that they are not critical, but minor mistakes are actually a big problem when it comes to essay writing. Multiple mistakes, no matter how minor, add up and they interrupt the flow of the essay and put a burden on the reader.  There is another major problem regarding grammar mistakes that has to do with perception. Students seems to think that minor mistakes are not a big deal but these mistakes often lower the reader's perception of the author's intelligence (whether on a  conscious or subconscious level)  . This, of course, is extremely unfair and illogical (if anything, recognizing that you can communicate effectively in a second language should raise their perception of your intelligence), but it is a reality.  Again, I really don't think you should have received a 1 based on minor mistakes in grammar but I also think that one of the points of this course is to identify how we can improve our writing.;Students seem to think-----oh how ironic :);I feel the same way you did about Alice in Wonderland. I found it clever and there were parts that made me laugh out loud, however, it was a little unsettling and I also found it a bit tiring to read. I also don't enjoy dream sequences or things that are too surreal (with the exception of paintings). They really hit me on a weird visceral level. For example, there is a little known movie called 'The Forbidden Zone' and it is exactly like someone recording a dream and it really freaked me out.;While I think Freud is interesting, and should be studied because he had such a profound effect on the field of psychology, I really am baffled by how many people cite his work as if it is still widely accepted in the scientific community. Most of Freud's ideas have been discredited, especially dream theory and penis envy, which seem to still be referenced a lot. There are so many interesting theories being studied right now in psychology and neuroscience and these ideas could easily be integrated into our essays. I just think analyzing a text based on Freudian theories is overdone. I don't think these Freudian theories add any level of deeper meaning to essays and I find them very tiresome and cliche.I don't want to make anyone angry and I am not trying to insult people who used Freud in their essays, because I am sure there were good essays that also referenced Freud. The professor spoke about Freud as well, so I am also assuming some people took their cues from his lectures. Again I am not trying to insult people. This is just my personal opinion. Are there others who feel this way as well, or am   I in the minority?  Also, don't worry I am not marking down papers because of my personal aversion to his ideas.  ;  I came across this article  http://boingboing.net/2007/10/15/neuroscience-of-alic.html   which has a link to an article  that described some possible neurological conditions exhibited by characters in Alice in Wonderland. It links some of these to afflictions suffered by Dodgson (like migraines and speech impediment). I suppose you could write an essay about the possibility that Dodgson's real life afflictions influenced influenced his writing, and also look at the implications of displaying and highlighting ''madness'' in Alice in Wonderland  in the context of  a society that basically locked away mentally ill people and kept them hidden away from the rest of society.  ;Your post is extremely aggressive. This type of post is actually the reason I don't think people should be able to post anonymously. I am not discrediting anyone's thoughts, I am simply stating that some of Freud's views are not accepted widely in modern Psychology. There has been a decline in psychoanalysis as well and its importance has waned in modern psychiatry. I believe this is because a lot of Freud's theories are not falsifiable which is a key component in the scientific method. I also understand that penis envy refers to children and not adults but that doesn't change the fact that it is generally not accepted anymore and it is misogynistic to the point of being absurd . I didn't say that everything Freud said was wrong. I acknowledged that he has had a very big influence. I also acknowledged that some people who cited Freud probably wrote interesting essays. All I said was that there are other sources out there that people can cite in addition to Freud. All in all it was a pretty innocuous statement that didn't warrant such an angry tirade.;The terminology isn't intimidating. I am just stating that penis envy isn't an accepted theory anymore. Sex is a huge factor in human behavior and it is a fascinating way in which to analyze readings. I am also an avid Dan Savage reader so i can pretty much handle any sex terminology you throw at me. Also, I studied anthropology/zoology as an undergrad, which involved a lot of genetics and human evolution courses, so I basically studied how sex drove us to become who we are. Actually if you are going to analyze readings and discuss theories on sexuality I imagine that there are a wealth of modern resources. Society has become more open so honestly more modern research may be more interesting/enlightening anyways. ;Agreed. I am living in Turkey at the moment and there are a lot of men and women who are uncomfortable talking about sex. I once made a mildly sexual joke in mixed company and instantly regretted it. Of course there are some people here that don't mind talking about sex but I have to be more cautious than if I were in some other places. ;"

Are modern fairytales still stories we can tell children without any fear that they'll be horrified or disturbed when wolf eats up grandmother?;I quite agree with what you say about homemade fairy tales; in my part of the world, children and adults likewise have a whole horde of fairy tales and fantasy sagas that are actually instilled in them- our bed-time stories always involve Indian folktales and hardly ever Snow White.

I can't watch horror movies either, (they stay in my head for weeks, maybe months,) but I can read pretty much anything in the fantasy line, except vampires.  I don't read horror, and vampires have never successfully crossed out of horror and into fantasy in any positive way for me. I mean, they are the soul less, undead. What's to like about them?    I also am very bothered by the way they shun the sunlight. I am personally very affected by the absence of light and I think a creature who lives perpetually in the dark, must be more disturbed than we can begin to imagine. There is a natural healing in sunlight that vampires never receive. When I first saw the programme,    Hoarders,    I experienced a similar feeling of horror and revulsion towards them because they choose to live in filth, (always,) and darkness, (often.)   Like the vampires they have turned away from the light with all that metaphorically implies.    Finally, consider that a vampire can turn you into a vampire against your will, they can fly and they can move unnaturally fast. The moving very fast really gets to me. They look human but they move like a housefly. That   s just wrong.  So, to summarise, vampires are creatures of horror and never creatures of fantasy for me. I don   t read horror, and actually if this course had been called, Fantasy, Science Fiction and Horror, I wouldn   t have even read the details.  I would just like to add that hoarders don   t bother me half so much as vampires. After all they can   t fly and are generally pretty slow moving.

So, my little lost self in a whirl of summer school papers waiting patiently to be graded got the better of me! So here is my essay:  Within the context of fairy tales, many are set within a forest dealing with small children. The forest can symbolize  the journey all children must face when preparing to become adults, those dreaded teenage years. Each journey, like in Little Redcap and Hansel and Gretel, begin at home where the child feels secure with their parents and their parents looking out for them. However, when the story enters into its rising action the setting takes on a darker setting within a forest. The forest can be treacherous place which is a    dark night    (Grimm 88). Many of the characters find the forest to be frightening and have many encounters with    wild beasts    and    goblins    (214, 138).    Forests are home to creatures like ""witch[es],"" ""dwarves,"" and many different types of animals. Some of the beings can be benevolent and kind. While yet, others are referring to challenging individuals every child must face through their teen years. For instance, in Hansel and Gretel the children arrived at a house after their long journey, only to find a witch who wanted to eat them for supper. After much planning and conniving by the children, they managed to overcome the witch obstacle and go home with plenty of money. Many children face multiple kinds of obstacles in their journey throughout life.  The forest may be a symbol of a journey through life complete with the obstacles children must face in order to be adults. No one can teach the children some of these lessons except for experience and these stories teach us, the audience, that childhood is a journey through the woods with wolves and witches to snatch us on our way.

I guess it has been a long time since I  have looked at the Grimm Brothers material.  The stories were not meant for very young children.  There are many things that would be very disturbing to sensitive young people.  For example the story of Hansel and Grethel tells about children being abandoned by their parents.  Another story with a similar theme is The Brother and Sister.  Each is played against the other.The Grimm Brothers also used other themes that would be lost on youngsters.  People need to be careful when they choose their friends and partners is another topic and conversing with animals, which I realize is the fantasy part, also a topic that children wouldn't understand.  These underlying areas make any kind of depth possible for the young reader.  The Grimm Brothers also seemed to use numerology.  They liked the numbers three and twelve.  A lot of the stories had three characters or the main character met three other people .  An example of this would be The three Spinsters and The Mouse The Bird and The Sausage.  I will say most of the stories do have happy endings.  Is this an expected ending or is it justified?I question whether these stories are actually appropriate for children or should they be given to older teens and see what they can make of them.  I think that The Brothers Grimm could probably be a course in itself.  It might've very interesting to delve into the meaning of all the in's and out's of these fairy tales.  What were the brothers thinking when these stories were written?  We're the stories just stories meant to entertain?I thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to reread some of the stories I have read before and read a lot of new stories that I found very interesting.   ;"

I thought it was midnight.;I am taking another Coursera course concurrently, and that one has an ""Assignments"" tab. That makes it much easier, and I was also looking for that here.;This is very interesting! I considered writing my essay about people using disguises in order to enact justice, but I hadn't thought about cloth itself as a metaphor for fate. You're right. Many characters tried to change fate by wearing certain cloths, but it did not always work.There are also stories in which disguising oneself with cloth is what leads to fate playing itself out, such as Maiden Maleen.;I agree, and your essay goes hand-in-hand with mine. (Though you might not necessarily agree with mine.) My thesis is that the stories promote the social structure of the time, though at first they appear to promote an overthrow of it. Because there is so much social movement within the stories, it leads the reader to believe in some sort of ultimate fairness or justice that will occur, in which people with virtues will be rewarded and end up holding higher places in society, and people with vices will not.;Here is my essay for the first assignment:  Grimm   s Fairy Tales promote, over and over, that an individual should accept his/her prescribed social role while acting fairly and honestly within it. At first glance the assessment that individuals should accept their roles in society might seem counter-intuitive since many stories involve characters that are poor or in lower positions within society overthrowing Kings or otherwise triumphing and moving up the social ladder.A closer look makes it clear that, on the whole, the stories do not advocate an overthrow of the social structure, however. When a lower class individual overthrows or outsmarts someone with more power, it is generally because that person has already been established as unfair. A lower class individual is portrayed as a villain when outsmarting a fair, honest person of stature. For example, the peasant in Old Hildebrand is the hero because he outsmarts the parson who wants to spend a day with the peasant   s wife, something that involves dishonesty. The waiting-maid in The Goose-Girl is not a hero for outsmarting the Princess, however, because that Princess wasn   t established as a bad person in any way.This morality is an    eye for an eye    type of philosophy rather than one focused on ideals. Breaking the social rules as a means to a greater end is fine, i.e., although trickery is despised, it is lauded when used to bring down those who used it first and are no longer considered innocent. Honesty and fairness, although highly valued, are not valued above all. Once a person has done something dishonest or unfair, the general social rules do not apply to them. Kings can then be overthrown and servants may be mistreated. This is considered justice, and those who apply it are heroes. This is seen in a multitude of stories, such as King Thrushbeard, in which the Princess is being haughty and rejecting all suitors. The King   s deceit is a good thing that both teaches the Princess a lesson and brings her greater happiness in the end. (I would argue that the Princess wasn   t doing anything wrong in the first place, but clearly she was according to the author and the social rules of the time.);Thanks for commenting on my essay. I appreciate it. I wrote it in a word processing document and was well under the word limit,   but then made some tweaks after pasting it here and I forgot to recheck it.  I think I left out a strong conclusion because I wrote something longer than the assignment. Next time I will be more careful to make sure an entire essay fits within the constraints given to us.

Here it is:On the Grimm Brothers fairy tales I found a common subject: the reward for your virtue or vice.  In the tales, virtues as  humility as the goose girl who takes the job without protesting, sagacity as Clever Gretel who fools his master, solidarity as the companions on the six soldiers and many more are rewarded with the deserved kingdom, the desired pleasures and a treasure respectively. In the other hand vices have their pay back; nonsense (Hans in luck loose all what have earned), avarice (the waiting-woman is killed for her betrayal), and selfishness (the hen even causes the dead of all the animals around her).Hern  ndez, Isabel (2012) arghes that all those tales where actually taken from oral tradition. The original ones were told in order to lecture the young ones about everyday life: you should be wise so you obtain good deeds (Six soldiers of fortune, Clever Gretel) and don't be foolish (Hans in luck), not to go to dangerous places (Little red-cap).  All this is presented via universal subjects, common to all ethnics and persistent in time such as love, hatred, marriage and human relationships, even when all those have changed in time. A prove of that is that is that adaptations of the same stories are used today with the same goal.I am an amateur storyteller. When you tale a story, you don't tale it exactly as it was written. You usually make small changes to adapt the story to the audience and inevitably you put a little of your own frame of mind. The original meaning of the stories should change when the Grimm Brothers took them from the ones that told them, and adapt them to their own audience (Hern  ndez, Isabel, 2012).Note: I am not native English speaker. I will really appreciate any advice regarding the form of my writing in order to improve it. Thanks.Hern  ndez, Isabel (2012).

TRUE,St623,Coh2,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0.001297859,0,"                  The stories of the Grimm brothers significantly lack elements of realism, opting more for exaggeration that keep the stories more in common with folk tales than with more modern fiction, like that of novels, films, or television series. Take, for instance, in the story of Six Soldiers of Fortune, where one of the men lays down to sleep in the middle of a race where, were he to lose, his head would be chopped off. Animals all seem to be anthropomorphic, with many capable of talking to humans (as the horses in The Goose Girl story, who speak even post-mortem). These elements add a fantastical touch even in stories that lack magic in a significant form.                        As well as keeping to the unrealistic and fantastic, the stories waste no words or time, many of the stories spanning a short amount of time, with only a few vague descriptors, usually to promote the beauty (or lack thereof) of a character; as with the princess in The Goose Girl. While the fantastic nature and the lack of descriptive language of the stories would appear simple and childlike (as the stories are meant for children), the dark subject matter of the stories appears to conflict with the stories construct. This antagonistic nature of the Tales makes them all the more intriguing.;"

Anxious for your comments :)On The Rabbit   s Bride       The Rabbit   s Bride discusses in a highly symbolic way, much like the myth of Persephone, the circle of life (birth- growing up- marriage- death), using animal and food imagery.       Persephone, or Kore (meaning maiden, virgin), represents rebirth, the coming of spring and vegetation, since only when she returns from the Underworld her mother, Demeter, lets the plants grow. The Maiden of the fairytale, a young girl, is responsible for the cabbages, for, when she is not there, the rabbit will eat them and the household (the smaller unit of society) will be out of food. Both Persephone and the Maiden are stolen in nature     the first when collecting flowers, the latter protecting the cabbages- by a figure symbolizing death.         Seeing the Rabbit   s Bride as Persephone, the Hare is Hades and his hutch the Underworld. The Hare, the Crow and the Fox in many mythologies are linked with death and trickery, being cunning, attractive, convincing but also dangerous and deathly. However, in the land of the dead, life can start over by a marriage, that will lead eventually to birth of children. Unlike Persephone, the Maiden never gets married to the Hare. Instead a figure made of straw    dies    and remains in the Underworld in her place reminding us of the Christian belief or the Platonic philosophy that when our body dies, our spirit goes on living. In the case of Persephone and the Maiden, they both return home continuing to protect earth   s vegetation and marking the continuing circle of life.       As a last not, fairytales, even though they are considered as stories for children, include complex mythological, philosophical and religious notions, blending traditions of different cultures and making them available to young kids in a simple, non-threatening and interesting way.  ;"
TRUE,St625,Coh2,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0.001297859,0,"Here is my assignment. I would appreciate any feedback.The Grimm Fairytales are unique stories, because they use animal characters to impart moral lesson to people. At a casual reading, the analogies to humans are not evident, but on closer perusal, one can see how animals are used to represent the vulnerabilities of human character in a distanced and objective way.       The Rabbit   s Bride    follows the story of a tactless Rabbit who imposes demands on an innocent maiden.    Sit on my tail,       get to work and cook some bran and cabbage,    and    Get up! Get up!    he orders the maiden, treating her like a housewife. When the maiden escapes, the Rabbit is left    very sad,    concluding the moral of the story: those who demand selfishly only end up alone and unhappy. Through the character of the Rabbit, the reader can recognize the man that is portrayed, a counter-example of good principles.         The Death of the Hen    similarly uses animals to illustrate a warning for human beings about following others. The hen   s death from choking on a nut sends the cock in grief, which then moves all the beasts to mimic the cock   s lament. The animals follow him to a dangerous brook, where one by one, all, except the cock and dead hen, drown trying to cross the brook. Finally following after the hen, the cock    sat himself down and lamented so sore that at last he died.    For a fairytale, this story resonates tragically. The story exaggerates the folly of offering to help beyond one   s capabilities, a lesson being that there is nothing that left to do for one that has died, but there is no need to follow after.    The Grimm Fairytales are fantasies, woven around animal characters who do impossible things, but they are also imbedded in reality. They remain with people today, in the minds of children and adults, because the stories cautionary warnings about human nature in a memorable way.    Word count: 316  ;"

The mother started the lie, the daughter can be seen as being loyal to the mother by not correcting the lie and therefore sullying the mother's word/reputation.   Then at the wedding the daughter/bride invites the three women in   as opposed to other girls in other tales who are cruel/break promises   to ugly characters and thereby incite their wrath. By keeping her word to the spinsters the daughter is rewarded by never having to spin again (or I guess actually   fake spinning again).     My point is I saw the girl as a dutiful daughter and keeper of promises (which is why she was rewarded), even if she was lazy and wouldn't learn to spin. :)And as an aside I can also see a more modern feminist reading of this as the solidarity of women-hood or some such--but sometimes I think we read more into these tales than we should :)Any way--just something that popped in my head.

Watching the ""Rapunzel"" video now and I don't think I'll ever be able to do an actual ""close"" reading---totally missed the whole 'eye' imagery thing.

The mother seized the opportunity to find her daughter a great husband. The daughter was witty enough to secure the marriage and relief herself from the spinning duties to the end of her life. So, it is the mother and the daughter outwitting the queen and her son in a game of marrige.The Element of the three spinsters remain as a mysterious hand. Why do they appear? Here comes the professor's link to the Three Sisters of Fate. The girl was meant to marry the prince, and they came to make sure of it. They spinned her marriage, and they asked to be acknowledged. The girl is smart: she acknowledged them, and secured a good living.Well, until they cut the thread.At face value, the story has no moral that a parent would like to teach their child, except that: if I lie, continue my thread of lies. However, as a story about fate in marriage, it is solid.This is a personal opinion, of course.;"

Throughout the books there are references to lessons (which are often cited incorrectly). I think this is Carroll taking the mickey out of what could only be thought of as the education system (which much of the western world has inherited). Students recite things over and over without any actual understanding of what they are doing, yet creativity and passion is ultimately lost.;Do not think of the book as being set in Wonderland. Imagine that you are a child in Victorian England: the absurd societal rules that do not make any sense, the easily offended characters, the prudish and snobbish nature of society (and the accompanying ambiguity), the way you are treated (as a silly child). Perhaps then it might make more sense?;It has been suggested that this is an allusion to a food chain: raven eats worm, worm eats desk. Food as a means for (almost immediate) physical and emotional change is constant throughout the books. The food chain could be symbolic of this change in the ""real world""?  As to the ""answer"" to the riddle: it is probably more symbolic of the ridiculousness of wonderland, and has no ""real"" (logical) answer.;Very nicely summed-up. However, advanced vocabulary can often reflect a very poor writing style. It reminds me of when Faulkner spoke of Hemingway:    'He has never been known to use a word that might send a reader to the  dictionary.' To which Hemingway replied, 'Does he really think big emotions come from big words?... There are older and simpler and better words, and those are the ones I use.'  My advice: Beware of the big words!*Not that I was there at the time.;Point taken :-);I was actually thinking about this for my essay topic.The thin line between sanity and madness is crossed by almost all the characters for various reasons (desire for longevity, grief, mania in the irony). Perhaps denying truth, in Harkers case, leads to insanity; acceptance of truth leads to recovery. Often superstition is thought of as a result of madness, yet denying the reality of Dracula (in the book, of course) and not having an open mind results in denial (which leads to uncertainty and madness).;Random, but all I could think of was this:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp3WrHxo4rA  It is called a trip to the moon and is one of the oldest sci fi films out there.

It's my pleasure to have any comments of you, thank you.My interpretation of little red cap who described as a maid in the tale is the newbie of the society. This youngster was curious about all new things and had no idea of the nature of them. She followed to what the wolf said first time, who I think represents the desire, the greed and the sin because the wolf just said nice words to her, the young lady with no experiences. However, little red cap, who was easy to absorb new things and easy to believe stranger's words also very insightful. She recognized that the door standing open (pp. 133), and the unusual features of ""grandmother"" though she had no fear nor solution to react this situation. What's more, she's also a quickly learner for she never making the same mistake at all.  Speaking of grandmother, who was full of love and kind and wisdom, I consider her as the god mother. She seldom said any words but be very nice to little red cap. The mother asked little red cap to bring bread and wine to her grandmother, which indicated that it's a sacrifice to the god mother. What's more, the mother said: Make haste and start before it grows hot, and walk properly and nicely (pp.132) don't forget to say, Good morning, instead of staring about you. (pp. 132) This part is so likely to make a pilgrimage or go to church to pray on Sunday mornings. Though the grandmother was weak in the tale, it didn't mean she's feeble. Her physical body was really weak but the spirit wasn't. Also in the second part of the story grandmother was a wise skillful old woman who gave instructions to little red cap in order to help her fight the devil wolf, which also demonstrates that she's in the upper level and love little red cap, the youngsters in her way.;"

I chuckled when sentences and paragraphs were described as too short. Unfortunately in a society where speech is reduced to sound bites, where texting is a major form of communication and where sentences which are short, concise - and uncomplicated - are praised, practise with writing long complex sentences, which attempt to address nuance and subtlety, while striving to maintain a strong sense of energy, is often lacking. Contradictory reviews add another note of humorous interest when considering the reviews.;I see the tension between extra-natural and technological as two circles with one wrapping the other. I am using the word extra-natural because I want to get away from the connotations of supernatural. The inner circle is the natural world - but with a twist. The twist is the extra-natural world which, while following its own rules, exists outside the natural world. It exists as its own nature which parallels the world of nature as we see it.Surrounding this world as an evolutionary development for a society is the technological world. The technological world of typewriters and phonographs is a sort of layer that overlays the natural world.The emphasis on technology - and by extension science, including the science of the human mind - might be an implicit suggestion that the natural world itself is subject to the examination of science and manipulation of technology. But with the additional piece that while Dracula exists in the extra-natural world where he can change form and influence the winds, that possibly even the extra-natural world can be subject to the scientific mind if only the right tools and thinking is applied. I suggest this because van Helsing's scientific approach implies that science and logic can be used to defeat Dracula - because even though Dracula has powers that exceed the natural universe - that he still has weaknesses and rules. The existence of rules, patterns and needs make the object of study still available to study and control by science. Even the use of religious things can still be part of the scientific approach since the religious things (such as a cross) are still considered to be facts of the natural world.Thinking this out leads me to wonder if part of the subtext of Dracula is a question of what is reality. Is Stoker implying that what we consider reality is probably just one aspect of that reality but that there are more levels and layers of reality? What layers might they be? Both microscopic and cosmological; single cells under the microscope and stars in the telescope. Even atomic theory, the implication of which we do not see with our eyes, but which manifests in the forms of heat energy for nuclear power plants and the explosive material of nuclear bombs. So maybe Stoker is using a literary tool to declare that he believes that reality is much wider and deeper than most people believe. Shakespeare said it best when he wrote, ""There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,Than are dreamt of in your philosophy."";"

OUR PEERS' COMMENTS ON FORM FOLLOW: peer 2     This is not an essay. I believe the author is trying to write his/her own version of a fairy tale, which to my knowledge was not the assignment. At least it is creative! peer 3     Well done dear, your languages are well spelt out and your sentences are well constructed. however your argument is a little weak and needs serious improvement, i did not fully understand the idea or message that you tried to pass across, i do not know if it is for my lack of understanding or that the message is not properly conveyed. i hope you will do better in other assignment. peer 4     Creativity is certainly at will. The structure is well, although repetitions could have been avoided. PEERS' COMMENTS ON CONTENT: peer 2     The piece does demonstrate understanding of the fairy tales and remarks on their consequences in modern day society. I cannot really find an argument to evaluate that is related to the text. To my knowledge, the assignment said specifically not to try to remark on modern issues outside of the literary world, but rather to analyze the fairy tales themselves. I don't think I can give this piece a strong score. peer 3     Well there is no strong argument or insights in your essay, i tried to see if there is any moral lesson that i can learn from the write up but could not find any; i suggest that you make more researches on essay writing and improve your self for a better write-up in the near future. peer 4     I didn't see any point to be discussed or analysed. Maybe stating what such comparisons or analogies should be considered, by this way the creative aspect could serve as a guide.

Some of us take our role-playing far too seriously for we easily forget the bigger game called real life. What I miss in a course like this is not the teacherly thousands but the few students who want to think about what they are learning and apply it to the contemporary world we share. At any rate, Poulomi, thanks for letting me know that at least one peer is thinking outside the boxes.  ;Thank you, Sharon. That psychological experiment should be better known. It is so apt and worrisome. It is  The Lord of the Flies that comes to my mind when I try to understand the intellectual boot camp camaraderie over this assignment. This is not a writing course, but its structure dangerously misleads the drill  sergeants standing over their peers.  Thanks again. Cheers!;Let's not overemphasize grades. Rather what these books and lectures involve should be our focus. Another literary course, The Fiction of Relationship, goes to great lengths to avoid the attitudes expressed so profusely in this course. If you are interested, Professor Arnold Weinstein's guidelines for that course follow: On Peer Assessment and Course Credit To pick up where we left off with the Announcement of yesterday, 14 June 2013, the question was asked:   How do the grades I get on my papers affect my chances at getting credit in the course     whether it   s a Statement of Accomplishment or a Statement of Distinction?  All Statements of Accomplishment and Statements of Distinction are based on whether you have completed the written assignments in a satisfactory manner.    Satisfactory completion    of the written assignments means that you have scored at least a one (1) on all required written assignments. In other words, you did not score a zero (0) on any assignment. If you do score a zero (0), then the material you submitted has been deemed incomplete by your peers in the course. With an incomplete on one assignment, you will not receive a Statement of Accomplishment or a Statement of Distinction.  OK. But how do I avoid a zero (0)? What kind of work could be scored a zero (0)?  Incomplete written work     work worthy of a zero (0) No Credit     can take many forms. The submitted essay may be blank; the submitted essay may contain completely unreadable text, or it may have text duplicated again and again to fill the required minimum of words. These papers are primarily what we have in mind when defining what is worthy of a zero (0). Incomplete work may, however, also include essays that are clearly and significantly fewer than the word minimum required by the assignment. So     if you submit only a 5-word, a 50-word or a 200-word response to the 300-word analytical or creative prompt, this would not be sufficient. That paper would be incomplete and worthy of a zero (0).  Please take note of what is not an Incomplete or zero (0).  Incomplete essays are not essays the peer assessor simply disagrees with, or thinks are unintelligent. You are, of course, encouraged to disagree and debate the claims made by your classmates, but do not mark essays with a zero (0) simply because you think the paper is wrong. Instead, use the comments section in peer assessment as an opportunity to vigorously and respectfully debate their claims. That will be more rewarding for you and for the student who submitted the paper. Further, incomplete essays are also not essays that simply have grammatical or formal mistakes (even many, many mistakes). So long as the essay is readable and strives to engage with that week   s reading in what appears to be a sincere and honest way, the paper is worthy of a grade above zero. **Lastly, on this point, we at Brown University are very aware that the student body of this course is very diverse, comprising many native speakers of English but also many non-native speakers who may not have much experience with argumentative writing in English. We ask that all students respect this fact and keep it in mind when peer-reviewing the essays. First and foremost, the goal of our peer assessment system is to help others improve their writing and improve their interpretative ability with literary texts. Those who possess strong skills in these areas have an important role to play in respectfully critiquing the writing of others who want to better their own interpretative abilities in the English language. Yes, you must assign a numerical grade to each paper, but we encourage all peer assessors to concentrate less on the number and more on engaging your classmates with critical comments and helpful feedback in each review.  The real value of peer assessment lies in your willingness to debate and help your classmates explore the substantive ideas of their essays!  So are you saying that I can get the lowest passing score [a one (1)] on all analytical and creative papers, and still receive credit for the course -- a Statement of Accomplishment or a Statement of Distinction?  Yes. You need to score only a one (1) on all required assignments to get a Statement. Of course, in order to fully complete each of these assignments, you must also assess the work of at least three of your peers. Peer assessment is an indispensable part of each paper.  Do all the papers follow the same rubric or scale of grading for peer assessment?  No. The 300-500 word analytical papers are reviewed on a scale of 0-3 with three (3) being the highest score and zero (0) the score for an incomplete, no credit (NC) paper. The 300-500 word creative papers are reviewed on a scale of 0-2 with two (2) being the highest score, and zero (0) the score for an incomplete, no credit (NC) paper. The 1000-1300 final paper will be reviewed on a combination of the above scales with an overall total of five (5) being the highest score and zero (0) the score for an incomplete, no credit (NC) paper.  OK, I know that zero (0) is an incomplete on a peer-graded assignment, but what does a one (1), a two (2) or a three (3) mean?  For an explanation of these numbers on the analytical papers, we refer you to the assignment on Manon Lescaut where their meaning is clearly laid out in the Evaluation/Feedback section on that page. The creative papers are reviewed on a scale of 0-2. There is no grade of three (3) for creative papers. When peer-assessing the creative papers, you will use this criterion. You will be asked the simple question,    Did this paper deepen your understanding of the    Fiction of Relationship    both as it relates to this week   s text and as it exists in the world at large?    If your answer is yes, you award the paper a two (2), and then carefully explain how and why it deepened your understanding. If your answer is no, you award the paper a one (1), and then respectfully explain how and why the paper failed to deepen your understanding of that week   s reading. If the paper is incomplete (see the guidelines set out in points #2 and #3 above), assign the paper a zero (0) for No Credit (NC).   I understand how the 300-500 word creative papers will be graded. But what exactly is a creative paper? How is it different from the analytical paper I am writing this week?  In the analytical papers, we ask you to compose and defend your own argument about the novels    formal qualities, themes and/or structure. We hope you   ll break down or    loosen up    the significance behind particular scenes, characters, or literary elements through your interpretation (the term, analysis coming from the ancient Greek verb,  _  _         _ _, meaning    to unloose, to investigate, to set free, to resolve, to loose from moorings   ). We want you to focus on and closely read precise features of the language used in the stories, and when possible, you should relate their meaning to the larger themes of the course. In the creative papers, by contrast, we ask you to respond to specific language in a prompt based on each text. The goal here, however, is not analysis as such, but synthesis instead--the term, synthesis, coming from the ancient Greek for    a putting together, a joining, a combination or composition of parts so as to form a whole   . What this means, in practical terms, is that you should explore the questions raised by the prompt, not just as they relate to that week   s reading, but also as those questions converge and merge with something outside the limits of our class   s reading list, whether that something is an object, an experience, or a theory you know and think applies to the reading and the prompt.  You have great freedom to choose a focus here. You could, for example, decide to write a philosophical reflection comparing or contrasting the themes of that week's reading to another novel, poem, work of visual or musical art, philosophical approach, religious practice, or scientific theory you know well.  You could also choose to compose a piece of short fiction or poetry for your creative paper. However, if you select this option, we ask that you provide your reviewers with a rationale of approximately 150-200 words, explaining how your poem or piece of fiction is related to the prompt given.  The form your creative paper takes is yours to determine. It is the work of your imagination, but you should make every effort to link it to the week's reading and the language set out in the prompt.  Can you elaborate on what is required for the final paper (1000-1300 words)? Is it different than the analytical and creative papers?  We will explain the final paper in greater detail a few weeks prior to its due date. But for now, let   s ensure we are clear on the expectations for the 300-500 word analytical and creative papers.  OK, can you recap? What do I need to do get credit in this course? Whether I want a Statement of Accomplishment or a Statement of Distinction?  Here   s a summary.  To get a Statement of Accomplishment you must: A. Do the reading over the first six weeks, write and then submit on time through the Assignments page: One 300-500 word Analytical Paper One 300-500 word Creative Paper One 1000-1300 word Final Paper Late submissions cannot be accepted. B. You must score higher than a zero (0) on all of these submitted assignments. C. Following each assignment you complete, you must assess the work of at least three of your peers before the assessment deadline. This means that over the course of Module One, you will assess nine papers. To receive a Statement of Distinction, you must:  A. Do all the reading over twelve weeks, write and then submit on time through the Assignments page: Two 300-500 word Analytical Papers Two 300-500 word Creative Papers One 1000-1300 word Final Paper Late submissions cannot be accepted. B. You must score higher than a zero (0) on all of these submitted assignments. C. Following each assignment you complete, you must assess the work of at least three of your peers before the assessment deadline. This means that over the course of Modules One and Two, you will assess a total of at least fifteen papers.  Finally, if you have further questions about peer assessment, course credit or about any of the written assignments, we encourage to let us know through an appropriate thread on the discussion forum.  ;"

Mainly, when s/he says things like: ""the writing is altogether too confusing and disengaging""; ""there are too many rhetorical questions that not only confuses the reader, but also dissuades them from the writer's argument"" (I thought rhetorical questions had the power to engage the reader and give the opportunity for reader to make up his/her own ideas about the question); ""Organize your thoughts before you write an essay"" (Are they really so  disorganized?); ""try reading it to yourself, and think if a 3 year old could understand it"" (I think this is hilarious); ""try not to write as you speak, but follow the grammatical rules in writing"" (about such observation, I would say that it is compliment, for  writing  as speaking is the best way to engage a reader. Reading an essay about a tale should be just like the tale was intended to be delivered: spoken.I would appreciate comments on my points above.Here is the essay:What is the meaning  of  life?  Many find none at all. Such a dry perspective is based on the reductionist view that all is matter. Consequently,  one is not able to see beyond the materiality that surrounds oneself. The tale of  Hans in Luck  discusses such a tense binary: meaning-life. Besides, a secondary binary element deals with another tension, which is found in the structures of social life. On one hand we have voluntary association, on the other, familial ties. Indeed, structures that can easily become conflicting. Such a sub-tension will underpin how the character will ultimately decide what is meaningful for himself.   The present tale has a possible important lesson to teach: no matter what we are entitled to own, things are good for a temporary moment; goods are not what will shape our existence.  Thus, as soon as one thing becomes a burden, it should be discarded. Successively, Hans trades his seven year salary, which is fully materialized into a single piece of gold    as big as his head       would his mind initially set on the shine or worth of wealth?    for horse, then horse for cow, cow for pig, pig for goose, goose for grindstone    apparently, what mindless or meaningless trades!?    Finally, when near water, he accidently let the grindstone fall in the water; it sinks; it is gone. Surprisingly, instead of desperation for losing his seven year payment    initially shining and finally opaque   , Hans is very glad because he has nothing else that would hinder his journey   s progress; definitely, there are greater values in life than being attached to material things. For Hans, nothing is more precious than arriving at his mother's home; nothing is more valuable than the company of the one he loves and loves him.  Moral lesson: Utility is what we attach to things, but only the inutility of love can give us meaning  in  life.Overall evaluation/feedbackNote: this section can only be filled out during the evaluation phase.To review how to approach evaluating this assignment, please revisit the section on ""Peer Evaluation"" on the ""Work Expectations"" page and two video clips in Unit 00 - Getting Started, ""How to Read for this Course"" and ""How to Write for this Course.""

There were lots of discussions in the forum about this tale and different opinions, but I think you have summarized quite well the real meaning of it.peer 2      Your content is fantastic, you really understand the motives and longings of Hans and his quest to find happiness. I especially loved the sentence at the end of your first paragraph about the sub-tension (ohhhh that lovely word choice) of the relationships Hans has at the beginning of the tale. The way you elegantly placed it at the end of the first paragraph solidifies the thought in my mind as I read the second part. The only thing i would add (and it is a small thing at that) is something about the loss of wealth with each successive trade Hans does (horse is worth more than cow, cow is worth more than pig ect ect)peer 3      Well done story description and argumentation of thoughts. It would be preferably to use some external source for deeper analysis and comparison with other tales.peer 4      ""What is the meaning of life? Many find none at all."" This immediately caught my attention. Also, the writer has written interesting and reasonable insights that I agree upon such as: ""The present tale has a possible important lesson to teach: no matter what we are entitled to own, things are good for a temporary moment; goods are not what can ultimately shape our existence."" However, the supporting examples are too weak and confusing. For example, there are too many rhetorical questions that not only confuses the reader, but also dissuades them from the writer's argument, such as: ""...would his mind initially set on the shine or ""worth"" of wealth?"" and ""apparently, what mindless or meaningless trades!?"" The writing would be much better in content, if the writer simply stated his/her point and given a quote/example from the story.

When this is done, you can add on the meat of jotting down direct examples from the story that go along with your points. If you want to go further, try to playing with your words and ""woo"" the reader.                                                  ;HI,Just clarifying and discussing a little further. Probably you don't see a tension between life and meaning, but I do. The tension is life on one side and meaning/full/less on other side. The tension is between two concepts: life and meaning. Also, there is a binary as well when I talk about voluntary association and family ties. According to the American English dictionary binary is ""consisting  of,  indicating,  or  involving  two."" The tension here involved is: will Hans give more value to voluntary association or family ties? Whenever one has to decide between two sides, then there is tension.The point you most disagree is about finding a moral on the tale. Your disagreement is based on a fallacious argument called  argumentum ad auctoritatem, that is, the professor says..., so it has to be like this. Actually, I do not agree with most of the Freudian hermeneutic adopted by professor Rabkin. Indeed, I respect his authority and appreciate very much his thoughtful insight. However, since his reading into the text and not from the text, I might agree or not. I agree that there is no moral to be found in every tale, but we can find in some of them. Barthes said that once the author releases his text, s/he is not the owner of it anymore; the author is dead; the reader can comprehend the text in a total different way. It is up to the reader to find or not if something (moral or no moral) is present in a text.Well. There is more, but it is enough. I believe that such a peer evaluation will be the burdensome of this course. Mainly because it is given too much power for a so diverse group made up of different views and level of education and knowledge about the subject.Best regards,Rosevarte;"

In other words, an expert must understand his subject with such clarity as to be able to explain it in the simplest terms to a layman. Lewis Carroll took his technical understanding a step further     he translated his mathematical knowledge into a story for children, who are laypeople where everything is concerned.  The original story Carroll told the Liddell children (Alice   s Adventures Under Ground) lacked several iconic characters such as the Mad Hatter, March Hare, Cheshire Cat and the pig-baby. They found their way into the published version as mathematical allusions. Stubbornly conservative, Carroll was unhappy with the radical mathematics of his time such as symbolic algebra, projective geometry and imaginary numbers, which he felt were not sufficiently grounded in reality. Alice   s Adventures in Wonderland satirizes these strange ideas in its most famous scenes. The most illuminating example of this is the Mad Tea-Party, where without the crucial element of Time, the three characters (or three terms of a    quaternion   ) rotate endlessly around the tea-table (or a plane). This is a reference to William Hamilton   s Quaternions, which could describe three-dimensional motion instead of motion in a plane.  When a book or story continues to resonate with its readers decades or centuries after it is published, it is often said of it that it contains    universal themes   . People still want to marry into rich families, just as they did in Elizabeth Bennett   s time, and still want legal redress for their problems, as they did when The Merchant of Venice was written. Lewis Carroll on the other hand, resonates with his modern readers not through his depiction of love or jealousy or justice, but because he could transform abstract technical concepts into enchanting characters and vividly ludicrous conversation. That is something no other technical expert has ever done so successfully.""  I would work on the continuity between paragraphs 2 and 3 and work out the connection between the Rutherford quote and what I have said about Carroll following that in paragraph 1 to improve it. I made an oversight and did not quote this video that helped me to write the essay, which should have come under citations:  http://riaus.org.au/events/alice-in-wonderland/Does anybody have any other suggestions?  ;Thank you so much! :);I agree with most of the above posts - science and faith mesh together in an interesting way in Van Helsing's character.   I would like to add that I did notice a few potentially mistaken bits of science. Quincey Morris narrates an anecdote where a horse of his was drained dry of blood in a single night by a vampire bat, which is really impossible. A single bat only consumes 1 fluid ounce of blood during a feeding, and while the wound bleeds for a while due to the anticoagulant in the saliva, that surely isn't enough to kill a horse. And I found it astonishing that Lucy could receive a transfusion of blood from four different people and not develop an adverse reaction. The only explanation is that she had AB +ve blood, which is one of the rarest of all blood types. Dracula was published only 3 years before Karl Landsteiner discovered blood typing, but I was disappointed when Dr. Van Helsing did not even pay lip service to the very likely event that the transfusions themselves might kill her. Surely he must have seen anaphylaxis after transfusions before, being a surgeon and all!  ;"
FALSE,St664,Coh5,1,1,1,4,5.05722,0.790949,1,0,1,0.003913894,0,"Here's my '6':Renfield's obsession with eating flies is one of the least understood aspects of Stoker's Dracula. In his original notes, Stoker called Renfield    Flyman   [1], yet in the novel he disguised the significance of the flies by never stating explicitly why Renfield started to devour them. Thus, when Seward wrote that Renfield was a 'zoophagous maniac' in eating live animals[2], he misunderstood the nature of his patient's deeper intent.Two types of flies can be identified in the book. The first were the common houseflies which Renfield baited with sugar, stored in boxes and ate compulsively. Ingesting these houseflies, symbols of evil, bearers of pestilence and objects of disgust, was believed by Renfield to give him longevity. According to Seward, the eating of flies 'was life, strong life, and gave life to him'. There are obvious parallels here to Dracula with his drinking of blood. When disallowed from eating flies, Renfield ate spiders, and, when forbidden from spiders, sparrows, not because he wanted live flesh, but because the flies were inside them.  More tellingly, the second kind of flies that Renfield consumed were blowflies.   A particularly disturbing scene depicts Renfield eating a blowfly 'bloated with some carrion food'. Blowflies, which usually feed on rotting flesh, are symbols of death stalking a person. A sense of putrefaction is prevalent throughout the novel, such as when Hawker noted that Dracula 'is surrounded by the smell of decay'. Significantly, it was Dracula who had been supplying Renfield with blowflies, the patient confessing near the end of his life that 'he used to send in the flies...great big fat ones with steel and sapphire on their wings'. Dracula, who was able to control Renfield in this way, can therefore be seen as personifying the Lord of the Flies, a translation of the biblical Beelzebub, more commonly known as the Prince of Demons or the Devil [3].  [1] Eighteen-Bisang, R. & Miller, E. (2008)  Bram Stoker's Notes for Dracula,  Jefferson: McFarland p.319[2] The term 'zoophagous', coined in 1835 by W. Kirby in his  On Power of God in Creation of Animals  (p.70), means animal eater. It fell out of use in 1840 when it was felt 'carnivore' was more suitable. Stoker resurrected the word to invent his disorder for Renfield. Today, 'zoophagia' is used to describe stage two of a psychological disorder called clinical vampirism, also know as 'Renfield's Syndrome'.[3] Jeffrey, D.L. (ed.) (1992)  Dictionary of Biblical Tradition in English Literature,  Grand Rapids: Eerdmans p.80;Haha. I thought I would get that comment. It was me in the last session who wrote the essay, but I couldn't finish it, so I am redoing the course. Maybe self-plagiarism, but I was rather proud of this essay.Are you redoing the course too?;That's OK. I had the problem of one of my young daughter's hitting the keyboard when I was at work and unenrolling by mistake. It was too late to reenroll, so I thought I'd try again, but using a few of the essays from before. I have also tackled some anew, as I am doing this week with Frankenstein.I did find in interesting that for my first essay on the Grimm Brothers (about the symbolism of hazel trees), last time I got 5.5 yet this time I got 4.5. I guess it's all about the luck of the draw.I have to say that out of the 30+ online courses I have done, this is one of my favourites. I'll probably end up doing it again in the future, trying to write all essays from a total new angle - I'm tempted to combine the knowledge from this course with the one on  Kierkegaard to produce 10 totally off-the-wall essays.;I just came across this on twitter...for anyone interested in a MOOC on linguistics, one has recently been posted, starting this fall.

Reading the stories I realised I had read most of them as a child, but like your daughter, I never saw anything dark in them the first time around. Reading them again now, years later, with the specific intent of reading for hidden meanings and symbolism I see a very dark side to the stories that I never picked up on as a child. So my ""shock"", was actually surprise that I didn't  ""see"" any of this darkness the first time around. Oh to be an innocent child again.Offended? No. This realisation led me to questions such as: what type of lives did people live that led them to make up these stories? In what context did parents tell their children these stories? What can we learn about life back them from reading these stories? Were they insignificant, incidental stories,  or a major part of child rearing practices back in the day?So my advice, don't stare at the darkness but become a detective! It sounds like this course will be a great learning opportunity for you, for you to look inwards and learn about yourself and what makes you tick. If you learn a bit about literature and writing along the way that would be a bonus.PS I'm new to all this and definitely no expert, so feel free to take my advice with a grain of salt (pardon the clich  )cheers;"

Here is the comment:peer 3      This is a perfect essay. Given the reference cited below, it seems likely that the author simply copied the essay from the reference. I wish I could think otherwise but I cannot. Awarding ones on this basis.While I am flattered that the person believes my essay is 'perfect' (I wouldn't agree here), I am quite offended about this accusation as it has no basis.   If it helps contextually, I am a high school English teacher; I would hope that my writing of essays is in some way effective.   I will copy and paste my essay for reference.   By the way, the works cited reference was for my Hemingway quote.My plea is this: please assess peers on the basis of what you see, not conjecture.   Students on this course put a lot of time into reading, thinking and writing essays so it is only fair that the same level of consideration be given when you are assessing a work as well.My essay:                 Grimm   s fairytales give us greater insight into human behavior and choices.   Despite the profusion of fantastical elements, such as animorphism, personification of the natural world, magic, and so on, the reader easily suspends disbelief by empathizing with characters.   We can immediately relate to the desires of the characters, and wring our hands at their misfortune brought on by poor decisions.   This suspension of disbelief and empathy is created in spite of the potent natural symbolism and fantastic elements, which in turn creates the timelessness and universal appeal of the stories.    The desires of the characters are the most striking feature and immediately create empathy.   Humble desires and actions help us respect people like the fisherman, as opposed to the insatiable greed of his wife in    The Fisherman and his Wife   .   The cheeky mischief of Tom Thumb makes us laugh, while the broken promises and betrayals (   Cat and Mouse in Partnership   ,    How Mrs Fox Married Again   ) make us cringe and acknowledge unethical actions.   Universal understandings of ethical behaviour are what help give these stories their timeless and universal appeal.  Natural symbolism is another prominent feature that immediately helps us relate to key meanings in the text.   Trees provide spiritual guidance (   The Almond Tree   ) and protection (   Fred and Kate   ).   Apples, with their biblical connotative meanings of both knowledge and danger, are a common motif (   The Golden Bird   ,    Snow White).   Gold also brings salvation to the poor, but also leads the greedy down the path of avarice (   The Golden Goose   ).   All such symbols are immediately recognizable for children everywhere, and the imbuement of magical or special properties in these seemingly common things engages our fascination and attention, helping us to look thoughtfully at the world and our place within it.  Hemingway once remarked,    All good books have one thing in common     they are truer than if they had really happened.      This is especially true in the case of these fairytales.   Universal truths about ethical behaviour are encoded within, and the natural symbolism and fantastic elements fascinate our minds and help us engage with these truths in more memorable ways.;"

They should not be ashamed of themselves to make such a mistake, but take the opportunity to learn from it.  And we should not deter fellow students from making similar accusations.

I hate Tom and Jerry personally because to me it is a series of rather violent but completely meaningless and mindless actions. It's gratuitous violence at its best, even if it is a cartoon and even if it's meant to be funny, it makes me profoundly uncomfortable. However I have no issue with the Grimm tales, or Dracula or Poe or any of the other works we are going to study.  There is violence in quite a lot of fantasy and science fiction stories, but it's important to consider why that violence is there in the first place. All the works we are studying are not mindless slasher novels but absolute literary classics that have withstood the test of time - therefore there has to be value in the violence within them.  Fantasy and Science Fiction often simply holds up a mirror to our society, and in showing us these alternate worlds it tells us a lot about the way things are in our world. At the time of the Brothers Grimm violence and extreme corporal punishments were very much a part of life. Even now, we live in a society that contains a significant amount of violence, and so it's only natural that this violence is reflected in works of arts and in literature.If the violence offends the OP or anyone else then that is probably a good place to start the analysis of the piece. We have the freedom to analyse any of these pieces on the grounds that we choose and what better place to start than with something to which you have a strong reaction to. What role does the violence play in the story? Why is it there? What does it tell us about the character, the authors, what does it tell us about society at the time, or even now? All the writers we are studying are literary masters and there will have been a reason for them inserting violence into their stories. Before dismissing any of these stories for their violence surely we first need to understand why it's there in the first place.   (by the way, I haven't read all the way to the bottom of the thread, I wanted to comment on this particular bit - sorry if this has all already been said below!);I'm doing my essay on another topic and since we can only submit one short essay I won't get the chance to discuss this so I thought I'd mention it here.  When Alice encounters the Red King sleeping, Tweedledee tells her he is dreaming of her. This reminded me of  Zhuangzi's question: ""Am I a man dreaming he is a butterfly, or a butterfly dreaming he is a man?"" after waking up from a vivid dream where he was a butterfly and was not aware of himself as a man.  Having the Red King asleep and dreaming of Alice in the Looking Glass world begs the question: is Alice dreaming of herself in Looking Glass world meeting the sleeping Red King, or is the Red King dreaming of Alice dreaming of being in Looking Glass world? In which case when she wakes up is it truly reality or still an extension of the Red King's dream?  Or are they like two mirrors face to face: Alice dreams of being in Looking Glass world meeting the Red King who's dreaming of Alice dreaming she is in   Looking Glass world   meeting the Red King....ad infinitum.  ;"

After all, what we remembered from our childhood is beautiful girls with beautiful clothes, parties with sweet cakes, charming princes, birds and cats that can talk, and so on. I once tried to read again many fairy tales when I was a grown up, and I was shocked. I guess maybe we only learn to value life when we are adults in a modern society. We value it so much that many people now oppose the death penalty. Children, on the other hand, can be cruel sometimes. And in old times, people also didn't value life as much as we do now. One can get handed just because of stealing! It is unimaginable today.But anyway, people die all the time in novels and TV shows. I love Holmes, Poirot, CSI, Criminal Minds, Bones, etc. And there are so many dead bodies in there. But I am enjoying these stories and shows.

I am a pacifist at heart, but I also have studied enough history to know that the humankind has used violence to fight off any peoples they consider to be ""others"".   The Inquisition, the Crusades, the European colonization of the Western hemisphere, Asia and Africa, the Jewish Holocaust, and African slave trade  were all brutal periods in human history.   Unfortunately, violence continues in  more recent times even in the so-called ""more civilized"" Western civilizations.   Examples, such as the CIA  supported tortures and murders in Latin America during the 1970s and  80s (e.g., ""los desaparecidos"".   Unfortunately, the ""eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth"" philosophy still permeates through much of the world.It  is not surprising to me that these fairly tales as oral history reflect their times and continue to resonate in modern times.   Isn't capital punishment/the death penalty still in effect in most parts of this country?   And, what about television and movies, and more importantly for our future, video games?   Isn't violence rampant throughout these media?So, the fact that fairy tales have violence is not shocking to me.   Unfortunately, the human race has not evolved beyond the use of force and violence to accomplish its goals.Fairy tales can serve as a reminder that we have to look deep and hard to uncover the ways in which we continue to glorify and justify violence from generation to generation.;Hello,I reviewed five students essays; however, I have not received any reviews of my essay.

So while I understand most of the  references  in the books, I can see while some of it may confuse someone who has never been exposed to British culture. Things that are second nature to a British reader such as afternoon tea, the references to  royalty   or the croquet game, may have the average American reader have to pause and think them through which I personally think makes the flow of the book a bit choppy since it is already a little scattered sometimes. Plus I find that most Americans are exposed to the Disney cartoon version early in life and never actually read the book until high school or later (if ever). Not sure when most British students are exposed to Alice, or how popular the ""Americanized"" movie version is in England, but I think this changes our  perception  of it as well.;I think the books are much more that of a young child's imagination and the way they see the world and not so psychedelic drug like.

Reciting information out loud and having music in the background may be a common study method. Other noises may become a distraction resulting in a need for a relatively quiet place.  Visual Learners: SeeVisual learners learn best by looking at graphics, watching a demonstration, or reading. For them, it's easy to look at charts and graphs, but they may have difficulty focusing while listening to an explanation.  Kinesthetic Learners: TouchKinesthetic learners process information best through a ""hands-on"" experience. Actually doing an activity can be the easiest way for them to learn. Sitting still while studying may be difficult, but writing things down makes it easier to understand.  Types of Learning Styles: What Everybody Should KnowAlthough most people use a combination of the three learning styles, they usually have a clear preference for one. Knowing and understanding the types of learning styles is important for students of any age. It is advantageous for students to understand their type of learning style early on so that homework and learning may become easier and less stressful in the future. Although it may be tempting to stick with what works, it's important to practice and train the other types of learning styles early on so that, as he grows, the child can utilize the other types just as effectively.

I take  Aesop's fables as an example as it was the first reading assignment. For instance, in Aesop's fables, I taking the following as an example of a write-up:""Natural symbolism is another prominent feature that immediately helps us relate to key meanings in the text.   Trees provide spiritual guidance (   The Almond Tree   ) and protection (   Fred and Kate   ).   Apples, with their biblical connotative meanings of both knowledge and danger, are a common motif (   The Golden Bird   ,    Snow White).   Gold also brings salvation to the poor, but also leads the greedy down the path of avarice (   The Golden Goose   ).   All such symbols are immediately recognizable for children everywhere, and the imbuement of magical or special properties in these seemingly common things engages our fascination and attention, helping us to look thoughtfully at the world and our place within it.""Please note that I have no disregard for this wonderful analysis. However, as somebody keen on getting his creative juices flowing to develop ideas and concepts better, as per my understanding, one would be better off not breaking everything down intellectually to this level. I do not believe writers critically break down associations and meanings held by objects and people, but do this in a more intuitive   way. Thus, creative writing, like music and art, is about what feels right and not what looks analytically and thematically accurate. I understand that snakes symbolically represent deceit, betrayal and slyness. I could see that in Adam and Eve's story, and could see that in Harry Potter as well. I would not sit and analyse the thematic unity in character traits of snakes before I get one to star in my books. I would be aware of this intuitively.My question is, in order to write creatively - is this not something to be understood and appreciated in an under the radar sense? As readers, the reason why books wow us is in their ideas, the motion, the stillness, the concepts and the beauty. Creative beauty, in my opinion, does not come through hard analysis, formulas, associations and dissection, but through letting one's imagination fly and feeling the beauty of ideas and concepts take over oneself.  How exactly then does critically analysing works to this depth help?;That's a beautiful answer! Thanks for sharing your insight!  I have a fear though. I fear that I will not be able to see the quilt as complete, as I used to before critically reading it. Would that make me lose sight of the sense of beauty and awe I find in a piece of work? Would deconstructing something to it's bare components make me lose the 'feel' of the story?  I think (and this is just a personal opinion and may be flawed) that to recreate magic in my writings, I need to keep my finger on the pulse of the what made the story awesome. By critically reading the story, and breaking it down into sub components, I would be able to see how the story is structured, how the author put certain events in a certain order to keep the reader guessing etc. This does help me understand ideas behind these areas as well. I feel I would however, lose track of what I loved about the story and the feeling I experienced. Ultimately, when writing a story, I often aim to recreate the kind of magic I felt while reading the other texts I have read. I feel that if I lose sight of what made those stories special, I will not be able to recreate that magic.Is there a recommended way in which authors should analyse stories? Should they do this critically? Or should they stick to the feel? I am not sure, but I do want to build better habits to write better stories! What do you think?;Loved your answer, and I connect to your thoughts very well.Thank you! That helps.;I agree. I often tend to wonder whether there is any intrinsic value to the deep intellectual analysis that works are put under. Those writings weren't made for this, and the analysis leads to naught. The purpose of the writings was to raise questions, not think about Mary Shelley and how her meeting with her husband shaped her decision to write about Frankenstein.As somebody who wishes to get into writing, I think it's a good idea to stop analyzing (or berating oneself at the dearth of intellectual output), and start writing.

Retract the fangs and I see a completely different tale, one that was forbidden  for its time period.   This story is about an espoused, respectable, straight man   s submersion into homosexuality.   In the Victorian Era it is improper to talk about sexual encounters, even straight sex. So we get an allegorical account of what happened.   Mr. Harker opens the with person after person telling him that he should turn back, saying what he is trying to do is wrong, waving signs to ward off evil spirits and crossing themselves, yet he continues on.   He hears the words: satan, devil, werewolf, witch, vampire and all sorts of admonishing and still continues on, even going through fire. He literally goes through hell, fire and damnation to get to the door of Castle Dracula and everything in him is urging him to turn back but still willingly enters when asked. This sounds, to me, like folks trying to talk someone out of choosing an alternate lifestyle, even a temporary one or going into a den of iniquity.  Once he accepts the invitation, he and the vampire get to know each other. As they become more intimate, Jonathan feigns innocence (as virgins do) and is apprehensive about proceeding but it   s too late. The trio of women are but another extension of Dracula   s psyche, performing unmentionable or unnatural acts. Men providing nourishment or being nursed on or being penetrated is considered emasculating acts or role reversal.  This new world is very scary and so are the new feelings. Jonathan is ashamed to be excited by what is considered an abomination that is, somehow, sexy.  He wants out but by this time Dracula is falling for him and tries to force him to stay. There's even a mention of Love. Jonathan  decides that his existence is not what he wants and escapes and then covers his deed with a hasty marriage.   They move on with their lives but his experience is a constant presence in their relationship. Maybe he   s living in the closet or    living on the down low,    as they say. Finally, his desires manifest itself in their bedroom and affects Mina negatively. Dracula   s escape on the Czarina Catherine vessel, while possessing Mina.     This ship is named for a woman known for her promiscuity or as a nymphomaniac. Mina trials could even represent an STD due to Jonathan's indescretions, some of which can cause infertility.  Jonathan then decides that he can no longer run from who he is and what he did and goes to the root of the problem to cut if off or behead it.   Van Helsing is Jonathan's concious and helps to restore their relationship. Now that his problem is dead, he and Mina can have a real marriage and start a family. The End.;"

So it would be ""flight of death"", which makes even more sense!  ;When I think of the death-eaters and that he sought the death wand and its power over other people's lives, I believe that he was a ""flight of death."" I think you are forgetting that immortality to Tom Riddle was a means to an end - namely an undead dictator who led by fear, not love. His image was meant to be terrible and not necessarily convey his desire for immortality, because in a way, he already had it. This is actually more similar to Dracula. Both had immortality and had to be whittled down first before destruction.Remember, that immortality is something Tom Riddle already had by the time he took the name Voldemort.  ;Excellent point. If I could revise my earlier assessment, I would say that Voldemort both feared death and wished to wield it as weapon. His earlier focus on horcruxes was replaced before the final battle with his search for the death wand. What was his motivation for this search? Because in so wielding, he would be immortal? Perhaps he believed that, but as we know from the story, all three brothers died because of their gifts. I am now wondering if his violent actions were intended to create a kind of horrific immortality upon the minds of muggles and magic-born alike.I feel like I need to re-read Riddle's earlier life in The Half-Blood Prince again. I just remember so much of the last book, but perhaps there are deeper motivations I neglected. I still think of Tom as that crying baby who inflicted his pain on others, very similar to Hitler, Napoleon and other similar ambitious world dictators.;A final point is that there is no immortality of physical form, even for the gods. Destruction can always occur as in the case of Dracula and Voldemort. Immortality is a dream with so many caveats so as to not be in itself immortality. Being perpetuated in history or converted to another form is a type of immortality, but not in keeping with the dream as I understand it.Is immortality the same as invincibility? After all, even those who are invincible may be subject to forces outside of human control, such as time or gravity.;Although I though Dracula overlong, the sexual puns, suggestions that both Arthur and Jonathan were cockolds, and the ridiculous justifications of what it means to be male or female has me in stitches.Throughout the entire time, I was wondering if this was merely a modernist view of Dracula and NOT what a contemporary Victorian audience would have seen.Two incidents of particular were of note to me. When Nina is walking back with Lucy, she makes a point to cover her feet in mud, so that from a distance it will look to a passerby that she is wearing shoes. Isn't that a bit extreme and laughable? And then of course, the first visit of Lucy's tomb, the ""sperm"" from Van Helsing's candle drips onto her face plate. As I understand it, there may have been something about whale sperm used in the wax of candles then, but still, isn't this an outward display of a lecherous old man?For me, the puns and allegory was so suggestive, that like reading Romeo and Juliet, I could help but laugh rather than being frightened by Dracula.;"

The creature, in his own bizarre way, seemed almost more ethical than the human.   ;The suit the monster is wearing in that Hugh Grant movie is pretty impressively well-tailored -- considering the creature is meant to be 8 feet tall...     ;With my Frankensteinian images formed largely through movies, I had always thought of the monster as a big, doltish creature who moved with the clunkiness of a rusted robot and had a more or less monosyllabic vocabulary of grunts and snarls, at best.   So it came as quite a surprise to read Shelley's depiction of an incredibly articulate being -- fond of Goethe, Plutarch and Milton -- who is not only huge and powerful but tremendously well-spoken and as graceful as an athlete. So, which image serves the story better? Obviously, the monster would not have been able to reason, beg, argue and plead with its maker as effectively had it been limited to a childlike vocabulary. And I suppose we're to think its pain at the cold rejection by humans is all the more keenly felt, given its intelligence?   The movie version, on the other hand, can perhaps better convey a sort of noble-savage image, a simple being frustrated by its limitations (though if he existed today, the NBA would love to get its hands on him!)   and by human rejection.What does anyone think?   ;Solitude is also an interesting theme when you compare/contrast this book to ""Dracula"" -- where a major theme was the constructive collaboration of a team of smart, competent -- and pretty level-headed -- people to find a solution to a frightening, existential threat.   ;Terrific observation, Elizabeth!   There's no doubt that the weather affects our mood and our outlook on life, and a cold, gray, weirdly abnormal summer like that would be bound to affect someone as sensitive as Shelley evidently was.   Thanks for pointing this out.;Actually,   there WERE other witnesses, at least if we take Frankenstein at his word:   ""Amidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia, although he still evaded me, I have ever followed in his track.  Sometimes the peasants, scared by this horrid apparition, informed me of his path; sometimes he himself, who feared that if I lost all trace of him I should despair and die, left some mark to guide me.""  ;Shelley devotes pages and pages and pages to the monster telling his story, all leading up to his request that Frankenstein make him a mate -- then in a few sentences, F. says no and the monster goes dashing angrily down the mountainside. She spends chapter after chapter describing F's change of heart and his final decision to make a ""bride"" for the monster, followed by his long, circuitous   trip to England and thence to his ocean-side laboratory -- then, in the course of a sentence or two, when the monster suddenly appears to watch, F. changes his mind and instantly destroys the work-in-progress (by the way, it's not hard to understand how F. could have found plenty of body parts in the big city -- but out there in the middle of nowhere??).   I just find the pacing horrible. It's all-or-nothing, either agonizingly slow, or else agonizingly fast -- the only constant being the agonizing part. I think Shelley needed a good (patient, talented) editor. Anyone else? ;Well, maybe ""pacing"" wasn't exactly the right word.   What I was trying to get at was that after a LOOOONG, drawn-out build-up,   Shelley reaches a point of climax but just seems to breeze past it without fully explaining, describing or elaborating how and why things happen.   It seems, for example, that just a glimpse of the monster as Frankenstein was working on the ""bride"" was enough to make him throw away months and months of work and planning in a moment.     Maybe it was just me, but I felt under-served.   It was if the candle she was working by was burning down to its final few flickers and she knew she had to wrap things up quickly.   I wanted more.    ;Oxana, that's absolutely relevant to Frankenstein.   During the creature's months in the shack up in the mountains, he fully convinces himself that because he loves and appreciates the family on the other side of the wall, and has nothing but the warmest and most complete admiration for them, and plans to approach them in a peaceful and loving manner, he can expect the same from them.

I like to interpret this as a science fiction novel which expresses the fear of technology's impact on our society and our survival.Saying the monster didn't exist is like saying that the machines weren't really harvesting the humans for energy in the Matrix (first movie) and that Keanu Reeves was just hallucinating. Both interpretations work, but the latter robs the story of its meaning.;I'm sorry to say that I thought both were pretty monotone. I thank god that Shelley at least had a better vocabulary. Whenever Stoker had to describe something positive he used the words 'good', 'sweet', 'pretty' and 'pure' no matter who the narrator. He even once described Mina as 'good, good, sweet, sweet' as if by repeating the same words he somehow made it better. As for the vampires, the only word he used to describe them was 'voluptuous'.Shelley has a better grasp over basic descriptions but nuanced characters and the power of suggestion seem to be beyond both their powers.;Your idea is very interesting. I don't really agree with it, mainly because I didn't see Shelley at any time even hint that this possibility is something she considered worth exploring. However, I see what you are driving at. The great similarity in the stories of the creator and creation can be an indication of a split personality. I mean:- Victor has intellectual passion that results in a discovery that results in monster.- Monster has academic inclinations that result in its question of identity that result in its anger.- Monster's anger results in victor's anger (death of William) and fear.- Victor's anger brings destruction upon Monster's bride.- Monster's anger brings destruction upon Victor.They have a symbiotic relationship going on. It literally looks like they feed off of each others passions. This could Victor's convoluted way of not taking responsibility for the deaths. He could attribute his creation of the monster to intellectual curiosity and the destruction of the bride to saving the planet from a new species. This would justify all the murders in the novel. I mean sure, he would feel bad and blame himself, but in his heart of hearts, he would know that he couldn't have done anything to stop that monster. It could be for this comfort that he creates this monster, as a thing to take the fall for his own misconducts. I don't entirely believe this, but its possible.What I find much more interesting is the suggestion that knowledge leads to misery. By the monster's own admission, its knowledge of human affairs was what led it to question its own identity, existence, and loneliness, thus ultimately leading to its grief. Frankenstein's acquisition of an amazing scientific advancement was what sealed his fate. Now, i am not a Christian, so I don't know if this is true, but in Ender's Shadow by Orson Scott Card, there is a biblical allusion to the tree of knowledge vs the tree of life. The implication (in the novel) is that superior powers of intellect must be compensated for by a shorter life. However, Mary Shelley goes way beyond this. She equates life to eros (life-force or sexual instinct) exhibited in Victor's act of creation and the monster's desire for a wife. Due to the consumption of the fruit from the tree of knowledge, the eros is converted to thanatos which is:  ""the hypothesis of a death instinct, the task of which is to lead organic life back into the inanimate state"". This is exhibited by Victor tearing up the monster's bride as well as the monster's murders. More disturbingly, Victor's pursuit of knowledge, the creation of the monster, threatened the logos, or the rationality principle. The monster's framing of Justine and its misuse of its knowledge of our justice system (note the similarity of the name Justine to justice) causes Elizabeth to begin to doubt in the integrity and fairness of the justice system. The monster begins to sow the seeds of anarchy, upsetting the smooth rationality of the current institutions.Thanatos is associated with counter-intuitive or unnatural behavior (such as the historical events the monster studied about). Murder definitely qualifies as both. Mary Shelley has repeatedly shown how the thirst for knowledge results in the unnatural and the grotesque. Although Frankenstein is a science fiction novel, rather than heralding the future, it shies away from it. In the novel, science is seen as something which disturbs the balance and progress as endangering the status quo. Any form of change (both social and evolutionary) is seen with fear. I find this regressive knowledge vs life attitude to be the central conflict of this novel, and in today's context, I think that this view is completely outdated. Right now, innovation is the only way to solve the world's problems. Retreating to the Swiss Alps and acting as if the industrial revolution never occurred isn't going to help. Neither are novels like Frankenstein.;I felt the same about the destruction of the bride. What I found even more annoying were the huge descriptions of natural beauty that seemed to have no bearing on the novel. I love huge descriptions when they are actually there for a purpose, such as symbolism or atmosphere (like in H P Lovecraft) but when they are repetitive scenes of beauty which serve no purpose other than to reiterate the protagonists despondency for the millionth time, I get kinda pissed off!;I think that large vision is never an excuse for shoddy craftsmanship. A writer cannot be a great artist with a brilliant story and no technique. The novel which suffers from this defect cannot be a great novel.;I think Frankenstein recoils from the monster because he is his own creation. Creation in the 19th century was attributed to God and the idea of man having the power to grant life must have been considered horrific. It is this belief which branded Frankenstein, his otherness caused by the identity of his creator. Before he was animated, Frankenstein's bench-mark of beauty must have been sculpture or works of art. However, after giving him life, Victor has challenged God and therefore, since man is inferior to God, his creation must also be inferior to God's creation. On animation, the bench-mark shifts to the perfection of the human form, and the monster falls short due to the human identity of his creator.;"

Such worry (that I mentioned at the top of this comment) seems just  Victor's paranoia; considering how badly the creature needed the bride and how his sorrowful experiences had lead him think like that,  Victor, as  a creator to take responsibility over his creation, should have satisfied the creature's modest wish.;"

So, please - be honest, I really want to know, and I will take no offense. Of course, any other ideas, comments or whatever are welcome. Thank you.Throughout  the centuries, many authors wrote about humans striving for perfection  at all costs. In the ancient Greece, the Myth of Icarus tells about a  man who flew to close to the Sun, thus destroying his own wings and  falling to death. That this motif is ubiquitous in all cultures, we can  conclude from looking into stories of Bladud, Jatayu and Kua Fu - who  represent the Briton, Indian and Chinese ""version of Icarus"",  respectively. The stories of ""why claiming the Sun"" are different for  these characters, but the actual cause is the same for all of them  (striving for perfection), just as is the final outcome (death). The  same idea appears in the Book of Genesis - Eve is tricked in eating from  the tree that will make her and Adam omnipotent, like God, but they are  punished by being excluded from Heaven. When comparing our world, the ""modern"" world, with the ancient  cultures, we claim ""progress and prosperity"". We claim that the science  and technology advancement allowed us to create a more developed  society. A society more evolved and better in all fields, from social  relations to healthcare. In the short-story ""The Birthmark"", N. Hawthorne writes about a  distinguished scientist, a man who astonished the whole Europe with his  mind's achievements. That man,  Aylmer, marries a woman with a birthmark  on her cheek, otherwise perfectly beautiful. Understanding this  perfection stained only by the birthmark, he uses all means available to  remove it. Eventually, he succeeds, but the wife dies. In this work, the author shows us that all these centuries, milions  of chips fabricated and bilions of engines manufactured later we still  suffer from the same weaknesses we suffered in the dawn of our time. The  human spirit is still willing to sacrifice himself and anything else  just to get a little bit closer to the perfection, for no matter how  short a time interval.FORM:peer 1     Form meets the satisfactory standard.  I found no structural errors.peer 2      The structure and grammar of the essay seems adequate. However, the  thesis presented did not have a conclusion. The third paragraph is a  description of the story and it is not needed since we all read the same  stories. I would suggest a bit more planning with the next essay. The  score for the Form is of 2.peer 4      Weird grammar fail, need for spell check, bad use of ""the"", and  confusingly constructed sentences. You did try for some big words  though.peer 5     Cite your workCONTENT:peer 1     This is a little hard to follow jumping to so many examples.  It is hard in 320 words to develop so many thoughts adequately.peer 2      The essay presents valid arguments. As mentioned earlier, the structure  of the essay and lack of conclusion makes it seem less insightful and  persuasive. Therefore, the score for the content is of 2.peer 4     Interesting idea but too much background and not enough from the work itself.COMMENTS:peer 1      I don't agree that these stories support striving for perfection as  much as seeking power.  Maybe  Aylmer wanted a ""perfect"" wife so he felt  more powerful as the possessor of the perfect woman.peer 4      Just really hard to read.

Nina has worded my concern very eloquently: any supplemental texts are written from the viewpoint of a person, and in some way reflects their thoughts and ideas on the topic, thus ""programming"" the reader's perception. While fretting over dry facts being presented by their proponents vs. opponents is probably going too far in this case, can ideas prompted by another person's understanding of the text be considered our own? Referencing is what I would do too, but there was no word of such option in introductory videos. I guess it boils down to whether the essay is supposed to be strictly the reader's comprehension of the perceived reading material, or a summary of a research the reader is capable and willing to do, analyse through his/her perspective and spit out on the paper?

The Grimm brothers very often mix medieval and pre-modern (as in the transition of medieval to modern times) with modern behaviors, places and objects. They were not the only ones, but the moralizing themes in their tales (or better: their takes on popular tales) may somewhat justify that, since they were trying to reach their contemporaries and at the same time maintain a sort of moral tradition. ;Megan - spoke to a good friend who writes wonderful modern history historical novels.

This leads me to believe that the peer reviews are a vehicle to critically analyze the essays of our classmates and gain alternate perspectives of the reading assignments, thus enriching our own experiences and thought processes.   Likewise, the peer reviews allow us to share our own perspectives and thoughts with other students regarding their own essays.   I think the intention is to learn how to provide and process constructive criticism to the benefit of all parties.   To that end, if you (in general) consistently receive 1's on your essays, then you aren't reading the comments and taking them to heart to improve your writing.   Again, paraphrasing the video, when you complete the course, if you have done all the assignments, your writing and thinking will have improved through the process of peer review.;I agree with everyone of Studio Ghibli, especially those by Hayao Miyazaki.Along the lines of anime I would also reccomend a series i just finished, Towa no quon.
