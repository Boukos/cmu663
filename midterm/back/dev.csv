As is what /everyone/ else perceives.Which always makes me think of the Street of the Gods from Simon Green's Nightside books, or Tai-tastigon from P.C. Hodgell's Godstalk - where believe literally shapes reality.At any rate, I look forward to a great deal of reading, both professionally and from my classmates, and hope we all have a blast.Carrie;Have you seen the work expectations page? It's good to read the whole lot I think and then concentrate on a particular theme or aspect.http://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/fantasysf/Documents/WorkExpectations.htmlAbout the essays it says'Your essays should aim to enrich the reading of a fellow student who is both intelligent and attentive to the readings and to the course. Each essay should be between 270 and 320 words. Attentive readers notice more than casual readers do, although casual readers may be responding unconsciously to many of the matters that attentive readers notice consciously. This difference in reading awareness arises in part from the fact that attention is limited. If I am attentive to the use of triples in fairy tales (three brothers on a quest, three questions testing the hero, and so on), then I might find that I   m not consciously attentive to other aspects of the narrative (the comparative intrinsic worth or worthlessness of the object of the quest, the rhetorical construction of a testing question, and so on). Because attention is limited, to understand works more deeply we need to slow down and take note of aspects of the reading that we find significant. Then, using those notes and reviewing the work, we can come to a hypothesis about what that significance might be. For example, if one notices that fairy godmothers occur only for child protagonists whose biological mother is dead, one might hypothesize that, at least psychologically, the fairy godmother takes the role of a mother and the fairy godmother   s entrance in a story is a promise of the love and protection that the protagonist has had taken away. The fairy godmother, then, is not so much a figure of magic as her magic is a metaphor for the continuing power of motherhood.Writing these essays and reading and commenting on the essays of your fellow students should make you much better prepared to learn from, and even question, the unit clips. Therefore, these essays should be submitted before viewing any of the unit clips other than the introduction'.;I f you click on Peer responses and then follow through to the Grimm brothers assignment there is a description of the assignment   that gives an example using the Sleeping Beauty story.

One specific problem is that I've lost the quantative requirements about percentages of 1's and 3's I can give.   As I recall it, with 4 essays to evaluate, how can I apply those percentages.   What if all four are particularly good?   Thanks for anyone's help.Cheers!;Thanks, Joshua!;Hi all!My name's Natalia, I'm from Spain and I'm quite excited for the course to start. Just took a look at the readings and seem very interesting and that will bring lots of new ideas and topics to talk about =)Hope to learn a lot and enjoy more!!;Hi, I'm David.    I'm a Primary level Science teacher from the U.S. but living in Thailand.  ;Hello everyone,I'm Harpreet from India. well, I'm a   law student who loves to read fiction novels. although I don't like science fiction but I joined this class to explore more about it. Hope it will be a fun here :);I'm Anika. I'm not too much older than some of you guys, I'm 17 and while science fiction is only something I've recently gotten more in to, I can't wait to read some these stories, and of course your essays.;Hello, I'm Beverly Nelson from Oregon, USA, and am excited to be in the course. I love reading and writing so am looking forward to learning all I can. This is my first course taken from Coursera but am enrolled to take four: two now and two in the Fall. Alongside this course I have ""The Fiction of Relationship"". I look forward to learning from everyone and reading the material. Thank you!  Beverly;Wow! It will be great to see you all in both classes and hear what you have to say about the material.  ;Hello everyone....m too doing the Fiction of relationship course :)nice to see so many people around the world ""like me"" Hope to see you all there as well.cheers!;Welcome to the class, Jim! I spent about six years in Chicago, 3 of those were spent in school, got MFA in Creative Writing there. I miss it so much but, like most, it got too cold for me. Never lived in weather like that before. I am excited to get moving in this class too! Take care.  ;Nina, I am in The Fiction of Relationship also! Nice to see you here! Looking forward to digging into the material, hearing the different perspectives. Take care.  ;Hi Michelle and welcome to the class! I was just looking over the Open U's course offerings the other day. Lots of great stuff but I had already signed up here and didn't want to overload myself. I'm in the Fiction of Relationships too! There's another person, Nina, who posted here, who is also in that course. I'm a bit nervous that I don't get my ideas between the readings for the different classes confused with each other. Organizing is not my strongest point. ""Busy...""   You got that right!  ;Thanks for sharing that Michelle. I'll keep it in mind.  ;Nice to meet you Endrell! I got my MFA in Creative Writing at SAIC and was in Chicago for about 6 years. I miss the place so much (except for the winters). It will be interesting to hear your perspective on the readings with your background and experience.   ;The one problem I have always had is coming up with a thesis. Either my mind has too many ideas about what might be going on in a story, or I have a problem with carrying a thought out to its logical conclusion. Likely the latter.  Hopefully this course will force me to hone that skill!;The priority here, it seems to me, is to read slowly and focus on developing close reading skills. Once we feel confident about that, any other resources or links would enrich our understanding of the   broader context around the work.;I'm not going to use any supplemental texts unless/until we get a firm answer on this, but in the past, I dealt with the issue by writing my essay first, and then scanning supplemental materials to see if I'd *missed* something (or worse, completely misinterpreted something!). Having said that, one of my English teachers in high school ""caught"" me checking out Cliffs Notes for The House of Seven Gables at the local public library and was aghast that one of her best students would resort to such a thing! Fortunately, I was in another teacher's class at that time, and trying to get to grips with *summer* reading... and I was nearly in tears trying to figure out what on earth he was on about. So she very kindly took an hour out of her day to explain the finer points of Hawthorne to me. I still hate Hawthorne with a passion, but I also still adore that teacher. I was lucky enough to have her again for AP English the following year, and she ended every class by making sure she had done her job well enough, and got us thinking about the material on our own enough, that none of us had to do something so horribly *gauche*   and *unimaginative* as resort to Cliffs Notes/Spark Notes. :);That is so awesome! I was just using Open Office.  ;Brasil, Rio Grande do Sul!;I've only read a couple of his sci fi books and one of his other books. Loved them all.;Hello everyone! :) Greetings from Crete, Heraklio! :) Hope we have fun and learn some interesting things here! :);Hyderabad, India added my location.;Is there anyone currently residing in Groningen, Netherlands? It would be great to meet for discussion once in a while.  ;My favorite book is Diary by Chuck Palahniuk. My favorite authors are Chuck Palahniuk, Augusten Burroughs, Kurt Vonnugut, Ernest Hemingway, George Orwell, and J.R.R. Tolkien. Although that list could become endless if I did not limit myself.  ;I think as far as fantasy and science fiction, my favorite is Ursula LeGuin. And my favorite books of hers are the earthsea trilogy. I don't read a lot of fantasy or science fiction these days. I am enjoying everyone's recommendations.;Let's see. My favorite author of all time is Virginia Woolf.I like quite a few Guatemalan authors (if you speak Spanish, I can upload some readings for you). Virginia Woolf is my favorite author of all time, yet some of my favorite (literature) books are:The Perks of Being a WallflowerThe Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar WaoInterpreter of MaladiesThe God of Small ThingsFebruary FlowersBlind Willow, Sleeping WomanThe Woman DestroyedIf on a Winter's Night a Traveller1984Brave New WorldAlice's Adventures in Wonderland... and well, many more, but those are my favorites.I confess myself a Harry Potter and Hunger Games, too.I'm also a HUGE fan on Jared Diamond's works. Anyone?;Ooohh, Diana Wynne Jones - so much fun to read. Tolkien and Hobb are other old friends - and of course, King. I am so going to have to go over this list once I get home and can hit up the library. Muhahahaha. *ahem*;I love Tolkien and Hobb!! Can't wait to start more of Hobb's books soon!;I love reading, especially fantasy books. There are books I have read many times, but when I fall in love with a book, I fall quickly and hard. When it comes to fantasy and science fiction, I adore The Harry Potter series, the Lord of the Rings trilogy and lately I fell in love with Anne Bishop's The Black Jewels Trilogy.  ;I read an overabundant amount of poetry. In fact, I never feel like I read too many books which I'd like to change. My favorite are Oscar Wilde, Walt Whitman, Maya Angelou, Robert Browning, Emily Dickinson, Thomas Gray, Sylvia Plath, Shakespeare, Gwendolyn Bennett. I'm really hoping to expand and start reading more books. ;Fav authors: Isaac Asimov and Terry Pratchet. Favorite genres: horror, sci-fi/fantasy, ghost stories, and the classics. Many of the books that we are suppose to read, I've already read at one point. I remember reading Dracula in jr high. And that was a while ago. It was an abridged version of it. I've read Lewis Carroll's works, Grimms Fairy Tales, and reread Frankenstein in the past 3 years. When I read, I read for pleasure, not exactly fond of taking apart stories for ""deeper meanings"", but will do my best. ;here is my profile! I just made it a week ago :Dhttp://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20450054-sana;Hello!Anyone from Edinburgh would like to meet up and form a study group? Me and M  lissa are meeting up this week and anyone based in Edinburgh is more than welcome to join!I hope there are more than two people in this course from this wonderful town and that we could form a nice group.;Hola :D Desde el D.F. creo que es buena idea que todos estemos en contacto para apoyarnos, les parece si hacemos un grupo en face?  ;Way to be a team player, Nicole! Thank you for your generosity! Hopefully we'll all find opportunities repay it as the course continues :) Enjoy yourself and cheers!;I read in English. My native language is Spanish. I think my understanding is pretty good, but I am more worried about the writing part.;You have time to get those books in English if you want and read them. If you're unsure about the translation, maybe it's a good option for you.  ;My native language is Icelandic but I prefer reading non-Icelandic books in English so I'll be reading all the books in this course in English.;Thank you so much for offering this course. I am very excited to get started. As I already read quite slowly, I was wondering if you could let us know what specific tales by the Brother's Grimm we will be discussing. I was not able to get the version suggested in the notes but I own a volume of Grimm's Complete Fairy Tales. I am not sure which tales overlap. I have been reading them in the evenings with my children but I would like to be sure to pay special attention to those that we will be discussing.;Thank you! That is a beautiful edition of these tales.;Thanks a lot! Librivox is almost always very good, though occasionally the old adage of ""You get what you pay for"" rings painfully true. ;I had the same problem and couldn't finish the course last time. My daughter unenrolled me by mistake and I was unable to enroll again.I plan to re-submit my essays, except for a couple I wasn't very happy with. Fortunately, I guess, I didn't see the lectures for most of the course so can't be influenced by them.I don't think you can have self-plagiarism, can you?;I am seriuoslt bummed that I need to bail out of this course. I believe that it is the perfect amalgamation between two of my great loves; writing and the inner working of the human mind but unfortunately I have dished too much into my plate at this time and as this is the most recent addition it is also the one that must take it's place on the back burner. Anything worth doing is worth doing right so I can't risk neglecting this course as a result of my other obligations or vice versa. I wish you all luck in the course and have added it to my watchlist so that i can be sure to hop on next time it comes around. But may I attempt at opening up a discussion before I leave? For interests sake. Why did you enroll in this course and what do you hope to learn from it? I was personally hoping to see if I could determine how external influences ( economic, geographic etc) could influence a writer. As well as the relationship between both science fiction and science fact and our need for fantasies as a society. I'm certain that you may believe that I am over reaching in my expectations of this course but I am certain that at least some of this may come to light, if not from the material then from the community involvement through Peer Responses and Forum posts.;try getting the files (books) in epub, mobi or azw, most of them are avaible in the links this site recomends, then you just open them on your kindle for pc with no problem, also you may try the calibre software to convert some of the files to formats the kindle and other e reading software use.mozilla Firefox has an e-reader that may come in handy in the future if the problem persists.  Calibre linkhttp://calibre-ebook.com/download_windowsSome of the books may be found here in e book formathttp://www.gutenberg.org/;I found this to be an interesting tale, too. I especially liked how the little lies she told just fell perfectly into place, as if she had been planning such a prank for years.;The Grimm tales haven't been part of my upbringing. I have read them as a part of the college curricula. I have been reading them again and I have enjoyed reading of 'Six Soldiers of Fortune'. It is very rhythmic story, I felt.  ;I had to go back and reread that section.   Notice how very delicately they mention that they were married for a while, and the prince came to her at a time of day when the witch wouldn't be there... ;);My version is a little different? He asked her to marry him but she said ""I would willingly go with thee, but I do not know how I shall get out. When thou comest, bring each time a silken rope, and I will make a ladder, and when it is quite ready I will get down by it out of the tower, and thou shalt take me away on thy horse."" Naughty naughty!;But consider the question she asks the witch that gives her away:""Mother Gothel, how is it that you climb up here so slowly, and the King's son is with me in a moment?""Clearly, though she can't climb down, he is not having any trouble climbing up!;I agree with both of you, however, I would like to point out a few things. Sci-fi was in it's own right a fantasy, an imagining of the possibilities of technology. But as we progressed closer to the reality of these fantasies, I feel that authors, screenwriters and even artists became too concerned with making their imagined 'technologies' more credible so that it could stand up to the scrutiny of their fanbase. So the artform became science in a fiction setting instead of fictional science. Which is why I feel that the resurgence of steampunk has become so prevalent. Sci-fi could do with a little more fantasy once again.;It interests me that SFF like Mieville's seems to go back to the early fantastic/weird tales of Jules Verne and co., and that Steampunk's really flowering.  ;Yes, glad to know. I hop e to be able to do this course. It's th e end of tehe schoolyear and I have to read final papers and tests from my students.Fortunatilly I've read mostra of th e books.Ser you in class;Yeah, I also saw it. My guess is they are left from the previous course.  ;Lol ... pleased others saw this.   I almost unenrolled thinking that I made the error!   Oh well, no doubt they'll get fixed up as soon as Prof sees this thread!;It seems to me the Professor is referring to the human ability of thinking up something they would like (or fear) to meet in the real life instead of fantasy as a genre of fiction. As an ability of mind, fantasy is necessary to produce any work of fiction, fantasy and science fiction just being the genres where this is the most evident. This is the way I understood the statement.;Thank you very much for explaining this to me.I understand how large the class is and of course the professor and staff are not going to grade everyone's essays (sorry, Emily, doesn't happen that way).In the Greek and Roman Mythology course, we also have to do at least five peer reviews (many of us decided to do more). These assessments were only counted as that we did them. The grades given by peers are not in any way reflected in the final grade. An assignment is considered completed when an essay is written, submitted, and the writer responds to at least five peer essays.To me, that is a much better solution. It is not a matter of getting lucky with peer reviewers, it is an ethical wrongdoing that goes against everything I have learned through my education courses and as a teacher myself.  ;Katrina, I feel like you may be feeling like you have your back up against a wall, especially as a result of some unhelpful anonymous comments. I'm not upset at all by your comments. I was struck by your strong objections to it as a grading schema. My comments are not meant as an attack in any form, more of a ""she's  making interesting points, I want to know more.""   My comments were intended as offering another way of thinking about the grading scheme. I'm a social scientist at heart so I'm thoroughly interested in effects of and reactions to educational processes. Peer review and its relationship to fostering skills and community are topics of great interest to me professionally. Can you talk more about what your ethical objections to peer review are? Is there a system you think would work more effectively (please see my comments about fear of robots with a grading schema like the Mythology course)? ;I was wondering about the whole peer review process at first, first of all afraid there would be too few people signed up for the course, second of all that the others would be.....um.....not likely to be helpful? is that the best way to put it?.....but look at the introductions, we have a LOT of people that we should be HONORED to get their opinions on our work, and I think we will get a lot of value out of this course.   I was wondering, though--if there are any outstanding essays, will they be shared with the rest of us?   ;Yes, they do. Amazing to think of how many are taking this course, over 30,000 on my previous course! Really looking forward to learning with the Professor.;In my experience from previous Coursera-courses, peer assessment as part of the final grade works fine. :) I am under the impression that people do evaluate others in the same way they hope that others evaluate them - fairly and thoughtfully. So I wouldn't worry too much about this right now. If you do feel however that you're repeatedly getting very unfair feedback, then you should of course bring it up again later. For now I'd say that there is no reason to worry.;Thank you, Anonymous, for that example.  ;Thank you all for your input. I really did not mean to spark a heated debate, and for that, I am sorry. Frankly, I am surprised at how many people are okay with this system and at some of the comments I received just from asking a question. I always thought I was a progressive educator, but there are some things in which I will not budge. At this point, we must agree to disagree.  I am glad I made someone laugh at least, if nothing else. Happy  reading all!;Hey guys. I hope i'm doing the right thing in exposing my thesis here.I'm hoping for some input, because I don't want to be overly confident about this and then find out there were a bunch of loop holes.  Reading the book I started to notice a difference in the roles played by luck and virtues in the stories where the hero is a man depending on the male's social status.   In other words, whenever the hero is a common man, be it a tailor or a soldier, he's role as a hero is only established through trials and the use of some skill or virtue. On the other hand, princes or ""king's sons"", as it is usually put, barely need any virtues for luck is always on their side. Take the princes in Rapunzel and Briar Rose, for exemple. The first one happens upon   the tower where the beautiful girl is trapped and is lucky enough to catch the enchantress calling the girl and climbing the tower. Not only that, after falling from the tower and having his eyes pierced, has the luck of bumping into his beloved now in the desert and having his ailments permanently cured. The second one is just lucky enough to find the castle just as the hundred year curse had expired and the thorns posed no danger anymore.The only example I found that might contradict this theory is ""The Frog-prince"", in which the prince had to use his cunning to have the princess keep her promise and break his spell. Although this is true, one can argue that this character is not really a prince, as his title was stripped from him, along with his luck, when he was turned into a creature that was less than human.So far, this is what I have. Can I get some comments from you guys? Am I on the right track?;I guess Gulliver's Travels is proof that not all utopian fiction is science fiction. It is interesting that we look back on these fantasy fictions and label them sci-fi because they are utopian or dystopian. I ask Where is the middle ground? is fantasy always so polarised?;I definitely think that dystopian fiction is science fiction. These are some of my favorite stories to read, and I have read tons of them :-) It makes me sad that most of the newer ones seem to be for teens or young adults, but I read them anyway and enjoy the amazing new worlds being created. My favorite is the Divergent series by Veronica Roth, and if you haven't read them, I would suggest you do!;  What are the pleasures of fairy tales? Where are the neuronal paths that create the attraction to these old tales? How is it that in this super fast changing world, still these tales make me pour myself a cup of tea and draw into a corner and sink in pleasure. The tales that defy every single thing I've ever been taught about causal chain, plotting, character building, narrative viewpoint. Everything. And old as they are, how is it that I cannot put the book down?  And as writers, how do we create an effect like this?;I totally agree, Anon. They do picture for us, what fear can do, what being brave can bring, and one of my favorites, Hans in Luck, the uplifting optimism. They paint the face of humanity, bare. Desires, fears, all bare, no makeup, no justification.  I marvel at them, despite the horror they sometimes depict.  Yet, I am at a loss in how to create an effect like that.   Thanks;To the Berkeley fellow I say: Oh, baloney.   The Grimms' stories have incredibly obvious biblical themes woven all through them.   And if he thinks Western Christians had to be duped by Disney into liking their own fairy tales, he needs to read Lewis and Tolkien a whole lot more closely.;What did everyone think of Pan's Labyrinth (or those who saw it)? I had a mixed reaction to it. And, while we are on the subject, I know so many fantasy fans that love Labyrinth, but that movie bugs me to no end. I just didn't think it was very well written and the acting wasn't all that great either. I thought Legend was much better done for that time.;I love Pan's Labyrinth. I agree that it did feel incomplete but for what was shown to the audience, I thought it was great.   ;OK here is my list in no specific order, sorry for any repeatsAnimated:Orphen (series)Robotech (series)Akira Final Fantasy: The Spirits WithinFinal Fantasy: Advent ChildrenThe Black CauldronG-Force (series)Helsing   (series)Elfen Lied (series)Outlaw Star (series)A Scanner DarklyTitan AERedwall (series)The Sacred Blacksmith (series)Bleach (series)Starship Troopers: Invasion   Ronin Warriors (series)Live Action:Children of men THXSerenityFirefly (series)Starship Troopers   Babylon ADEnemy MineStarmanRiverworld (mini-series);Do we have to read all the stories by the brothers Grim in the book which i am reading from here  http://www.archive.org/stream/householdstories00grimrich#page/2/mode/2up;Zijn er ook Nederlandse studenten in deze groep? ;"

This came under their academic honesty/plagiarism heading so I guess that, in a sense is could be said to be dishonest.All such discussions should be tempered by the fact that this is a non-credit course being taken for self-improvement. Anything which enhances that process seems valid. One can't turn back the clock of experience so, in my view, there is nothing dishonest about Pavel submitting new work and, again in my opinion, it seems pointless to do otherwise. What can he gain by resubmitting the same pieces? Will he get some new insight from the feedback offered by his peers? Possibly, but he seems likely to gain more from a re-examination of the source material in the light of his experiences.;Adoration for the Medieval period is an important part of   German Romanticism (as well as the forest, the countryside, traveling) - but the settings of the fairytales are not strictly medieval.

I don't think the writers in those days bothered with that.I may be wrong. Thoughts, anyone?;Can I be completely honest here? Anon, you will find that many of the stories in the book will leave you with this feeling of abrupt ending or not-so-good writing style. I believe we aren't reading this work for it's amazing syntax and form. Just find the hidden symbols and clues - mysticism, religion, social, and even psychological. That should be enough.

After that, you can hit the +comment link on the bottom right hand corner of each individual post and comments on the posts. Right below here;Sci-fi hasn't lost its awesome, we're just more realistic about it nowadays.   Everyone used to believe in the possibility of living like the Jetsons and Star trek.   And now we know that flying space cars most likely can't (but not impossible!) travel from planet to planet, or that buttons can't easily (yet) materialize a cooked meal in an instant.   Most of Hollywood focuses on the action part of sci-fi rather then the wonder (Look at War of the Worlds Remake or Falling Skies).   But then there are series like Doctor Who that have gone on forever and they can still scientifically justify why Daleks look like salt shakers, a space ship is a police phone box, and why there are sound effects in space.;Hi Anon, I think the 1.8 average applies to form and content separately, not the combined total, so you'd need to average 1.8 + 1.8 = 3.6 for each assignment to pass :);Very insightful comment! Thank you. ;Since this course isn't going on any college transcript of mine (and certainly isn't transferable!), I'm not worried about the grade.

I have never before been in a class where the official grades were given by other students, so I'm not really sure how I feel. I know that some of you are not taking this class seriously because you don't need it for anything, but there are some people who are taking this course for their job or for credit in some way or what have you. I feel a little uncomfortable about grading someone's work when it actually might COUNT. As for scores, I am confused about them too, especially after watching the videos about not giving all 3s but then getting an A?   I'm also a little annoyed that there are some people who don't think that helping others improve in any capacity without getting something out of it themselves is worth it. If you ask me, that is a part of what is wrong with our world right now.Sorry if the OPer wanted this thread to end or something...I'm confused when I read about deleted posts and all that, so I'm not sure if I said anything helpful at all.;And not to forget Philip K. Dick's ground-breaking novel  Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep  and the movie that changed it all -  Blade Runner. Felicity, thanks for mentioning Clockwork Orange. I remember the first time I watched it, I was simultaneously disgusted and amazed, repulsed and attracted by the ideas in the movie. I can't say I feel very differently about the movie today except that I now understand the underlying concepts more.  ;I've been avidly following the discussion, and it appears, that Grimm tales in particular speak mostly to those who read/heard them before, and have additional levels of perception triggered by the experience. This is definitely so for me. The tales I remember reading - not necessary in their original interpretation - are perceived with pleasure, while those I can't remember are a nightmare.

I heard that the stories were meant to reveal the ugly human nature rather than tales for children. I haven't started the readings yet, which version is that for the link provided by prof?;I've just read all of them, and I really wish I hadn't, I found it a very unpleasant experience - not sure I really want to think about them any more!

So if you've stuck to the 320 words limit before you paste it in then you'll still be fine.Edit: Coursera also counts hyphenated words, for example ""fair-haired"" as two separate words, I think.;Megan, as far as I can tell, anything that is separated by a space or punctuation mark of any kind counts as a separate word!

I wrote a pretty lengthy note on the last page of Kafka on the Shore because it affected me emotionally. 1Q84 was such a delightfully strange and complex novel with all of the Murakami staples (e.g. classical music, fixation with ears, surrealistic elements).

All of these people tell fairy tales, and that is just the beginning. Link, especially, tells wonderful fairy tales. Kij Johnson (who is published under Link's publishing house occasionally) is also good for this--her story ""Ponies"" is terribly dark and wonderful and very much a fairy tale. It's available for free online here, as well as part of Johnson's ""At the Mouth of the River of Bees"" which is also very good.Honestly, I think it's a matter of knowing where to look, especially if you want more traditional-styled tales. Having worked in ""literary publishing"" and gone to conventions and sat there and listened/added to the conversations, I know they're there--mostly in short story collections, books published by smaller presses (Small Beer!), and literary journals (The Fairy Tale Review pops into mind, although there are others). You just need to search a bit.;Literary journals are generally found at conventions, or purchased online through subscriptions or individual issues now-a-days. Honestly, most people I know who keep up with literary journals are people who either publish in them or people who work for one. It's very insular.Your best bet for most is independent bookstores and online, because chain bookstores generally only carry works published by the Big Six publishers, and most of these authors publish through smaller or indie presses. All of the authors I listed have actual, physical books released, although most are also available as ebooks too. Kelly Link actually releases most of her stories for free online, and I know Kij Johnson has a few free ones floating around online, too.Although all of the authors I mentioned are award-winning authors you probably aren't familiar because major publishing houses do not often publish short story collection outside of collections from people who are already majorly famous (story collections don't sell as well as novels)--and most of these authors are short story writers.That said, Jane Yolen is actually insanely famous, but mostly in the 90s. I've also never read anything by her, just been to a few lectures  and panels  she's done on fantasy and fairy tales.;Last month Indigo press released an anthology of modern stories of this genre entitled     ""Modern Grimmoire.""A clip from Goodreads--   http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17788344-modern-grimmoireTwo hundred years ago, Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm--better known as The Brothers Grimm--published their collection to ensure that the various German fables, tales and folklore of their age and before would not die out. Modern Grimmoire: Contemporary Fairy Tales, Fables & Folklore is a literary anthology in the Grimm persuasion.Awaiting you inside are the collected works of thirty-six emerging authors and artists from around the world, including prize recipients Michael Harris Cohen and Mandy Altimus Pond, along with Mona Awad, Catee Baugh, Tim Belden, Danielle Bellone, Amanda Block, Angela Buck, Simon P.

My original training is in philology and Jakob and Wilhelm Grimm were prominent figures in philology. As such, we discussed them and their work in great detail. As mentioned in this link:http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/IE_Main5_Grimm.htmlthey collected tales from all over Europe. Some of the village storytellers they interviewed to collect their tales were interviewed about it after the tales' publication. The Grimm brothers did not simply write their tales according to everything I ever encountered in the field.Moreover, one of my German instructors was a specialist in the Grimmmaerchen. He also confirmed this impression. My copy of the tales is the Goldmann edition (isbn 3442004128), containing the original German. Its introduction also refers to the tales as collected rather than written as original work by the two Grimm brothers.Certainly the tales were edited and the multiple versions of most tales collected compared, but I have never before heard the tales epresented as simply written by the Grimms.Am I misunderstanding something?;To address a few comments above;The stories,as I have always understand, were collected specifically to test certain philological theories and originally published with only other philologists in mind. So writing their own tales would have been counter-productive. I have always understood the brothers were happily surprised when the public also took an interest.I'm not sure I get the point of the Disney comments.;Dystopic fantasies anyone?

Next to video link on the right side.;In the story ""The Cat and Mouse Partnership"" the cat and mouse represent the multiple nature of humanity.   The cat represents the predatory selfishness, deception, and opportunism that humans exhibit.   His nature is illustrated by his statement that ""Nothing tastes so good as what one keeps for one's self""while eating the fat he and the mouse had saved for winter, when no food would be available. Also by his eating the mouse at the end of the story, he further demonstrates that he possesses these traits. The mouse on the other hand represents the trusting and altruistic side of humanity.   She holds up her end of her agreement with the cat, keeping house for him and trusting all the while that the fat they are saving for winter will be shared in lean times.   The cat's eating the mouse at the end of the story, followed by the statement ""and that is the way of the world"" indicates that these aspects of human nature are incompatible because those who are too trusting are bound to get taken advantage of.   I think gender roles are also important in this story but am not quite sure how, does anyone else have an opinion on that?;Perfect..

It helps in terms of creating and building up tension in stories as well as driving a point further. I agree with what you said that the first time is a random happenstance, the second time establishes the pattern, and the third time breaks it. While I do enjoy studying symbolisms in stories, I think that in this case maybe the use of threes is just for effect. After all, these stories were written for the purpose of teaching values and children learn better when there are patterns and repetition.;Three Blind Mice we sang as children. Once, twice, three times a lady goes the song. Two get along but a third intervening always evokes trouble, it upsets the situation. Really interesting thread and now we will all be noticing numbers in the fables we read.;I tried to submit my assignment, and it said I wasn't finished.   Since I had the correct number of words, and I had agreed to the honor code thing, I'm guessing that I HAVE TO cite sources, although I read somewhere that citing sources was not necessary if we had no sources to cite.   So.   I suppose I have to cite the Grimms?I went to the course wiki, looked at the sources listed by the previous students.   And saw that they had dates like 2007, 2008, for their Grimms.   So I'm wondering if the dates for the online version would not be the 1882 edition published by MacMillan & Co in London that is listed on the front page?   ;I could be horribly wrong, but I cited the material scanned rather then the year of scanning, so 1882 edition.

Looking up ""happy"" in a dictionary, I discovered the synonym, ""blissful"", meaning full of bliss, utter joy or contentment. These are attributes that emerge from internal as opposed to external stimuli. Hans is at peace with himself, and the world, and is therefore happy. Is this moralstic? Instructional? That's hard to say. ;Reminds me of the character Tom Hanks played in Forest Gump,  ;Hans is indeed lucky, he has inner peace and that is a wonderful thing to have. The gold means no more than the lump of rock, he does not need possessions to make him happy, how many of us would value that peace of mind in this material world.;Before I begin my post, a tad bit of info about me. I'm a college prof, computer science, but also a professional storyteller; think the oral story tradition. I registered for this course to engage in discussions of the types of writting I enjoy: tales and science fiction. I read and write and publsh SciFi. Now for the meat of my post. The Brothers Grimm did a wonderful thing by scouring the countryside for oral tales, which they then set down in written form. Or did they? How much of what they wrote is actually what they collected, transcribed, and how much is ""made up""? Let's leave that an open question, for now. Instead, allow me to discuss what happens when oral tales are transcribed. The Brothers Grimm are not the first to ever transcribe these ""folk"" tales. On the contrary, many, many individuals and groups have done so over time. The Foxfire series is a wonderful modern example of this sort of effort. But the way we speak is not the same as the way we write, yes, both are based on the same grammar rules, but that's perhaps where the similarities end. Both the act of telling a story and of writing a story demand that one knows the ""story"" first. Knowing a story, however, does not imply memorizing a story. Consider how when describing that fish you caught, it just keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger. Or, better yet, consider givng directions to someone how to get from point A to point B. Depending on who we retell this story to (and, yes, giving directions is telling a story), we may add or subtract details, as well as adjust the language used to match the listener's age, etc.  Yet, the story we retell is exactly the same each time. Why? Becase we know the story, and it from what we know that we recreate the oral delivery of the story. What one tells, or writes, is an instance of the story inside her head. How do we know stories? Again, that's another, related topic, for another discussion. Moving on to written stories, each is also a story instance. But unlike oral stories, written stories generally consist of complete sentences (not fragments), and contain sufficient detail for most readers. And oral story instance, therefore, is one state of an evolving story rendition, whereas written story instances are fixed for all time. Yes, there are multiple translations of Grimm tales, but they're all based on the same source material, differing in the intent ofbthe translator(s). Nuff said! ;Given the shear number of attendees, for thus course, I will assume there must be other unuversity-level faculty participating just for the joy of learning.

Also, there are many non-native English speakers, who struggle with the nuances of English writing.Kindness and constructive criticism will go a long ways towards building a vibrant learning community.Several of the peer feedback comments I received on the Grimm Brothers assignment were incredibly helpful and encouraging, Thank you to those kind souls, as I now have a much clearer direction for future writing.   It will indeed be a steep ""learning curve"" in this course regarding a literary writing style.I must admit, however, that I  also found some of the peer feedback I received to be unkind and more about advancing that person's ego and self-appointed status as an ""expert critic"".   This was really an inappropriate use of the peer feedback component of the course.This community of learners is diverse, so let's celebrate that diversity, not discourage other learners.Constructive criticism would be deeply appreciated by those of us struggling with writing in a literary style and/or those who are writing in a non-native language.We are all interested in life-long learning and everyone of us brings unique perspectives to the course that can enrich the learning of an intelligent and attentive audience.;The moral is like that of throwing a stone into the pond, it causes ripples.

I'm really learning that now that I have a 2.5yo. I want to say that this should be an ongoing dialogue over the years, that gets both more general and more specific as she gets older and has more life experience and opinions of her own to bring to bear.As an example, I'm nearly finished reading her Dodie Smith's The 101 Dalmations (ie the original from 1959, not the Disney versions, neither of which she has seen. She's only just learning to hear and understand a longer story, and is mostly enjoying this as something we do together, that's about dogs! So for her now I simply skipped the section with the Gypsies, as well as the patronising of Missus for her ""female"" lack of spatial awareness. The next time we read it together, and certainly when DD can read it for herself, she will presumably be more ready for some of the discussions around those representations. At the moment those are minor skippable parts of the narrative, so I'm skipping them.;Megan, Karen, Andrea et alI haven't had the chance to do more than skim the thread over the past few days, but thank you for being thought provoking and teaching me.;Marla, I keep coming back to your post and wanting to comment on how much I think we let 'BACK THEN' off the hook too much. I'm torn though, because it's the privilege of my education (familial, formal, and self-read) that means I was pretty aware of some of these topics 20 years ago as a teenager (sexism especially, anti-Semitism definitely, other racism + homophobia theoretically, transgender issues probably not at all) and knew vast swathes of history about some of it. (In 1994 I did a school project about Christine de Pisan, a 14th century French writer who argued strongly against the denigration of women, and addressed her writings (at least in theory) to women of all classes, not just queens and nobles.)In short, I don't think we can always excuse classic writers for their bigotry, even when we still read and discuss their work for its historic value and literary merit.;I read a good many of the original versions of Grimm's and Anderson's stories when I was eight or nine, but I was also exposed to the watered-down Disney-ed versions. The differences were so striking that I could help but think of them as different stories altogether, not just different versions of the same story. There was Ariel in the Little Mermaid, and there was the mute mermaid who had to walk on sharp knives and bleed in silence all day in the original version. The violence in many of the stories greatly disturbed me, particularly the thought of Snow White's stepmother being forced to dance in red-hot iron shoes till she died. That's why I think I have never thought of fairy tales as being simply ""for kids"". The watered-down versions certainly, but not the originals. With my recent re-reading of Grimm, I think it is more illuminating to think of fairy tales as being a window into the societies and cultures that they passed through. The true value of fairy tales is historical - these were the qualities valued in men and women, these were the prevailing attitudes, these were the common professions, this was the social structure.;OK, so I was exaggerating, but just a little.   :)   And what I am finding in evaluating essays is what I felt my problem was.   Ideas were not developed enough.   Yes, a theme can be stated in a sentence, but often I think the theme needs to be explained.   It is hard for me to adequately explain my thoughts in so small a space.   Most of the essays I have read seem incomplete because the good ideas or thesis (which many lacked) are not developed.   My original essay ran about 750   words on Word, and that was as economic as I thought I could be. I was shocked to see I was way over the word limit.   So I cut and changed, and re-wrote, re-thought and got the word count down, but I fear that the connections/points I wanted to make won't be obvious, that the essay will feel jumbled.   I hope we'll get to see a good essay that is within the word count limit.   So far, I have not seen any near one and I fear my own will fall into that category too.    I am a verbose writer, I know, so maybe this class will help me to learn to be more concise, although I write creative fiction mostly, not non-fiction.   ;I like your analogy, I think, but I am Math imparred, so it goes way over my head.   :0   ;Hi Luis, wath i really asked myself was : why was the rabbit in our world?;This is  a good idea for the new book. ;Gender issues in Dracula is something that has been examined for some time - in particular the nature of the roles both genders play - when I studied the text for pre university entry, I examined the idea that the female vampires became the ultimate threat for a man - women who penetrated rather than became penetrated - but then, in turn this came from their own penetration by Dracula - analogy for syphilis and the spread of disease, but also the transfer of power and the roles that vampire and hunters have compared to the traditional roles played in the 'family' home.;""He had impure thoughts, yes.

I had never read the book before or seen any of the films or television adaptations. So this was my first ever time of being introduced to Alice and the wonderful Wonderland. I fell in love with it. I think it's such an amazing book. I am not criticising the thread starter or anyone else by the way, because it is clearly a topic that a lot of people have discussed over the years. I was just never aware of it that's all. I just felt like I needed to say that. But also to say that I really do love this book. It was amazing to be introduced to Alice for the first time and see Wonderland through her eyes. I'm so glad to have stumbled upon this course.;What a lovely and thought provoking post. I also love Alice in Wonderland and viewing life from Alice's perspective as she tries to make sense of it all. Total classic.;paedophilia is not a sexual orientation. It is a mental illness/personality disorder.

How do I do that or can I now not continue on the course. I can't even find where I ask this question - feeling technologically challenged! ;Mine was evaluated 5.5, and am very happy about this grade and the sympathetic and useful comments of my peers. :-DBut one of them wrote I should have given more examples and explain them. Of course I was not able to do that due to the word limitation, since I followed it (ca 310 words). Btw, my second essay (about Alice) is already written, and has 320 words exactly.Good luck to you all.  ;So has mine!;It may be a a problem with particular browsers but the tech people should know.. It's much more difficult to write a short essay than a long one so they should be penalised in my opinion; as the person above has suggested.;Agree, the system should not accept anything over the word count. If I had such a long essay, I would just mark and read to the word count but luckily mine have all been okay so far.;I haven't received an overlong essay yet.   If I did, then it would get a 1 for form for ignoring the instructions (after checking the word count).   I wouldn't penalize it for content, though.;I have to agree with these posts, the grading is difficult. While most gave an attempt at a thesis, it was what I would consider an obvious thesis or something that we already knew. It did nothing to enrich or enlighten my thoughts on the collection as a whole or on an individual story. With that being said, this is a MOOC, while the syllabus says one thing for the type of student that should be in this course, that is not necessarily what is here. Who are we to say what is intelligent and what is not, I personally don't want to say that anyone is unintelligent, that is not my goal here. I say if there is at least an attempt at a thesis and a clear logical train of thought then hey, E for effort. If there is some work that can be done, I will be more than happy to give some polite constructive feedback. We are all here to get something different out of this class. I personally am interested to get others views on these classics and to finally get them read. Three quarters of the books on the syllabus are on my to be read list that I haven't gotten around to, and this is a good way to do it. Just my two cents on this whole grading thing that everyone is stressing over....;I find it hard to judge/evaluate essays that are clearly written by someone who for whom English is a second language.   I understand that everyone needs to use proper grammar, etc., but I found myself feeling guilty for giving low points when I realize that maybe it is not the ideas or concepts that seem flawed but the confusing way of expressing them.   ;Exactly, and this is after all a peer review. No one is going to get college credit for this course. I am interested in what others will say about my thoughts and I will take their feed back and welcome it. Give low points, don't give low points, it's really up to you as the one doing the grading. Just give your honest feedback. That is all you can really do. Some will get mad, some won't care. It all depends on why they are here.I will be honest, I am an avid reader, I read between 3 and 12 books per month, I have an above average IQ, I also have a GED because I dropped out of high school and have only completed 2 hours of college credit and those were online courses. Some would say I am not qualified to take this course per the syllabus, but I feel that I am qualified. So, here I am, like it or not.Don't get me wrong and think I am not taking this seriously, I am. I just don't expect much from other people, I am a pessimist. It will be what it will be. No point in getting your panties in a wad over it is all I am saying. ;);I think I may have been generous with my grades for this first time, but I don't think I will for the next go round.   Everyone should be learning how to write essays, and hopefully got some pointers.;Four of the essay simply didn't offer a thesis. One of them wrote why (s)he liked reading the tale (s)he chose. I didn't want to be harsh (but I guess I was :S), but I had to stress our assignment required us to propose what some patterns or aspects could suggest. I graded their contents a 1.;Professor Rabkin also sees Hans in love with his mother. Perhaps he's also projecting his personal prejudices onto the history of the Grimm brothers. Some people see what they want to see. And some people blindly follow them.;Why did Rabkin ignore all the women and children and powerless people who here killled horribly in the tales? It was an old woman who was shoved into an oven not a Jew.   Yet he is willing to dismiss this with a dated psychological fantasy.     The first victims of the Nazi killings were not Jews. They were disabled children and women and men.   Yet Rabkin seems not to express the same horror over these stories. Yes I do believe Rabkin showed prejudice.Because they do not follow Propp's rules means nothing. It does not show any malevolence or agenda of any kind. Fairy tales are adapted everywhere, the Grimms didn't do anything unusual. And even if in hindsight they seem poor folk lorists,   I didn't see any proof at all that they had any kind of agenda just a bunch of conjecture by Professor Rabkin .;You are ignoring the fact that the killing started with useless people much like the old women in Grimm not with the Jews. When people ignored that it spread on to the Jews.My point is that violence against ""useless"" old women being accepted is a more likely contribution to the Nazi mindset than any antisemiticism in Grimm. Violence against women and children and powerless people   is still happening today but people fixate on a period in history that everyone can agree is evil and so don't have to look at the world around them. Your inventing a ""backstory"" about blood libel doesn't change that.   The fear of being eaten is a primal fear that appears in a lot of cultures not just Europe.I'm disagreeing with   opinions   not denigrating the people who are making them.   ;http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/focus/disabilities/I've been assuming you understand my reference to the killings beginning with disabled and useless. But just in case.;I never said a campaign to harass useless old women was the real horror of Germany. The article I referred you to was from the holacaust musem. Do you have some prejudice against information that doesn't come from Wiki?;I didn't say their website supports that statement. I don't know if the people at the museum would agree or not. And neither do you. You have as much value as any other human being and you have as much right to argue as any one else does. Every individual has equal value. That's what I've been saying.;I am a little dismayed at the fact that although I took thoughtful time and consideration to write not only my essay but the peer reviews as well, in return I received peer reviews which did not meet up with the minimum guidelines of at least 30 words!   In addition, I think if you are making a statement on grammar and word usage, the reviewer might take the time to also submit the review in the same manner.   Incomplete sentences or just a few words doesn't give much credit to the reviewer.   Though some of the reviews had valid points, I was just a little disappointed that it appears as though the reviews were made last minute and haphazardly.   As I am not receiving a grade for this work, the reviews are important to be able to improve my writing skills.   I feel I wasted my time submitting reviews instead of reading the next assignment.   Sorry for the rant but I feel it is important to point out.I also noticed I only had 4 peer reviews - shouldn't there be 5?   I recall making at least 5 reviews.    I actually submitted a few more as it will help me in the long run to view other points of discussion for the reading assignment.   ;That sounds like an excellent idea too, you might want to focus on one or two, however, just so you can explore it in depth.  ;I agree. It   s not about pretending that grammar isn   t an issue because it is (if you can   t understand what someone else is trying to say then how do you expect to comment on it?), but the idea is to give constructive criticism rather than simply dismissing an exercise because the person doesn   t have a lot of experience writing in English.   I   m not a native English speaker, and one of the reasons I enrolled in this class was to practice and find ways to improve myself and communicate better with others. I would hate to find people here who either completely disregard anything I have to say because it   s not phrased properly, or don   t point out my mistakes for fear of making me feel bad, because we   re all here to learn.   ;I didn't mean he was wrong. It just   he was too harsh in my opinion. I search into Hobsbawn and Burns and not at once they make the link whit german's superior race. After all, nationalism was very strong everywhere and the ""germans"" was still trying to figured out what being a german meant.  ;Alice is unsure of her identity, she cannot recite the poem correctly and it appears that being in Wonderland has affected her. The caterpillar questions who she is and she is unsure as things keep changing.;I shouldn't answer this because I am already working my essay around it, but I don't think Carroll is defying the laws of our physical universe, if you look at mathematical laws and if you look at chaos theory which in early theory was developed by mathematicians, you can say that Wonderland is really built on mathematical law.However, since my essay will be based on this due to the amount of mathematical patterns I have seen in the story, I don't want to say anymore. I already don't know how to get it down to 320 words. LOL;Suggestion to all examining this - look closely at chess and its structures - indeed, there have been writings about Carroll's usage of chess metaphor, the ideas that relate to development and the logic behind it. Hope this helps.;Very good point with good examples as well Emma - I personally feel there is no difference in Wonderland and 'this' reality - [in regards to physics anyhow] - granted we don't have the size changing and talking animals, but that is more about perception rather than actual physics... isn't it?;Thanks for the link. This is an old version..http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrlN8rrmOVU;Well you should be on to Alice and Through the Looking Glass by now, and yes, I'd say you should read all of both books.;The program will not accept submissions exceeding the 10% standard allowed over the word count.  ;I have evaluated many more than five essays and none has been over the word count.;Mary how many paragraphs were they? 300 words is going to be about three or four average paragraphs.Also did you get the word count from MS Word or something else? I used Word for my essay and it was very close to the Coursera word count.;I find it difficult to imagine how ONE person out of the thousands enrolled in this course, received three essays, each one from three different people, totaling exactly 1,000 words. This is truly odd, an absolute abomination - especially since the program will not allow submissions of that length!     ;Hello, I have given grades to all 5 assignements with great hesitation. I do understand that overall in such MOOC, we should end up with 10-30% of the grades regarding the form and content being 1's, and not more than 20% of the grades being 3's. I understand that this should work when grading at least 20 assignments. (Which I  know I am welcome to do). However, I have found that very challenging on my particularly small selection of 5 assignements...   I am ending up for example with a  paper without conclusion and another paper entirely retelling the story... So, my question is: does this rule apply for our particular selection?;I should think it does not apply for any particular selection of essays. We are to grade the essays based on weather they are good or not and not just compare the 5 essays we are given.Having said that, I did find it helpful to assess more then 5 essays, as it did give me a chance to run into more quality essays and made me more confident in grading them.;I think I understand what you are saying. The percentages do not work out in the five essays I received either. Three of mine I'd like to give ones on everything to, and the other two are only satisfactory. None of them wowed me or even were up to snuff in my opinion. So, yeah, I just graded the fairest way I knew how and didn't worry about the percentages.;We are to review 5 essays. 6 and over is optional, but 5 is obligatory. ;I was happy with my evaluation. It was really nice to read the positive comments and I also appreciate the comments explaining to me where I could improve. I agreed with the suggestions offered  to me. One of my peers wrote the absolute bare minimum (about 5 words for each) which was frustrating because I couldn't really take much from what they said, but it could be that they simply didn't have the time to evaluate more than that. Overall, I feel happy with my results :);Same here. Nice comments, I agree where I made mistakes, but I had one person being negative without motive and in just one sentence. ""Everyone knows fairy tales do this"" isn't good feedback. And if you think about it, most of us know the themes that appear in the stories, so what, now we can't talk about them?;I got something along the lines of: really? that's your argument? if that's why the stories are great then all stories are great. I understand if people don't agree or are not convinced with the points I'm making, but there's no need for sarcasm as I am only learning and don't have all the answers.;I thought some of it was too subjective. I got marked down by someone and their comment was ""that's not what I would have focused on.""   I also think that the assignment details stating most should be graded as a 2 influenced graders to grant people a score of 2. ;Two of my reviewers were complimentary enough to make my day and the other 2 were lukewarm and complained about things that weren't required like not including more than one story in the 320 word analysis.  You just never know. It's kind of hard to write for such a diverse unknown audience. ;I don't know if I read your essay, but I did mention to one writer that I wish they had given examples from other stories, because it seemed like the assignment was to go over themes that were present in the whole book that we read. I didn't mark the essay down for it, it was just something that I thought would have made their essay even better which is what the reviewer is supposed to comment on. ;I had high hopes for the peer reviews since everyone's been saying how great and wonderful they are and unfortunately, I have been greatly disappointed. Two of my reviewers wrote only in the form and content sections with a few words each and that's all. Another reviewer just explained how he/she disagreed with me, but never talked about how I could improve my own essay's form or content. I only had four reviewers as well. How is it justified that some people are having five graders and others have less? My overall grade was high, but "

It takes a lot   of work.   I do try to be thorough and give good, useful comments.   But since I have been mostly rather disappointed in the essays, I wanted to read more, see if I could find a really good essay.   I discovered I could not read more without evaluating them, so I gave each of the optional ones what I felt was my honest assessment by numbers, but I made no comments.   I read until I found one I felt comfortable giving a 6, which was quite gratifying.  ;So could you possibly get evaluations from more than 4 people?    So far I've only gotten 4 each time.   So I am thinking not, that you only get comments/grading from among the original reviewers assigned to you.   Will all evaluations be seen by the author?   If you evaluate the ones you are assigned, the optional ones you do will or won't be seen by the authors? If the author does not see them, them comments don't matter.;Thanks for this information.   In the future, I'll not review if I don't have time to comment.   ;OK, I understand.   But I just don't have the time to do as thorough a job of reviewing more than I am assigned.   So I guess that means I shouldn't read more.;I think it is helpful to read all the essays you are given to review FIRST, before grading any of them.   It helps you get in the mood, get ready to focus better, I think.   Also, wine helps tremendously.  ;I was joking about the wine.   Is there an online wine tasting course?   That could be fun.   ;I think it's almost as hard to come up with comments as it is to write the essays.   I want to be helpful, but I'm not a teacher!   If I think it sounds like they're making up BS as they go along, should I call them on it?  ;I agree Florencia, the same thing happened to me. Last time I was marked down for spelling errors, so I proofread my paper a dozen or so times, and yet I was still given a 2 for form. The only negative feedback I received was that there were a few ""editing mistakes"" - which were not clarified, and after having 3 co-workers read it, we still never found any. Then, another person said I needed fewer paragraphs. Granted, I did have   5 paragraphs, but each one was the shift in a new idea or point, which is when you are supposed to write a new paragraph. I am confused on how this made my grade a 2 when the other 2 graders said my paper ""flowed beautifully"" and was well written and structured.I had an open mind last time and accepted what the reviewers said, but this time I feel my paper was better written and had really good feedback. I am super frustrated!!  ;Thanks Paul,     That actually does make me feel a little better. I think I am just holding myself to too high of a standard as I have an English degree and taught English for a number or years. Granted it has been a while, since I was in school. I just think some reviewers are being extremely nit-picky and looking for reasons to mark people down.   ;I find some of the essays so poorly written or thought out that giving a 1 seems like high praise.   In the future, perhaps there should be a 0 grade possible as there were in other Coursera classes I have taken.   Just a suggestion.   ;It was just a suggestion.   I have given 1s (and detailed comments ) to people I thought were trying and also to those who obviously didn't take the assignment seriously.   I felt bad for those who I thought were trying, but didn't quite come up to par (2), but for those who wasted my time, I would have liked the option to not give them any points.   If people knew that they could get a 0, perhaps the one sentence, non-sense works or writings that didn't in any way have anything to do with the assignment would stop. In the other classes I've taken where an essay and evaluations were required, there was always a 0 grade option.   In one there was also a criteria for citations, in addition to form and content.   One had to grade whether the citations were proper.   Actually, If it were me, I would like more options, from 0 to 5, which would then correspond with grading most understand.   0 = poor, 1 = tried, but not quite, 2 = adequate, 3 = above average and 4 = excellent.   Nobody would have to give a 0, but I think the option might be useful, would allow the reviewer more choices and give the authors a more accurate assessment of what the reviewer thought of their work.   And again, this is just a suggestion.   I respect your view;   we don't have to agree.         ;Okay, so the way we should look at the reviews is.....all of us are probably equally nervous about reviewing wrong, just as we're afraid of our essays not being quite right.   Or we are are absolutely adamant about the reviews we gave, as well as the perfection of the essays we wrote.   Or something like that.   Yeah, I think I waste too much time reading the forums, it just makes me stressed out.  ;One fact is Carroll's family never wanted to discuss his - probable - tendency for, or to, little girls.

Woo Hoo!   OK,   I know it really doesn't mean anything, but it was a lovely surprise.   Thanks all who gave me such praise.             I do believe,    said Alice at last,    that they live in the  same  house!      She was referring   to Tweedledum and Tweedledee, but in both  Alice in Wonderland  and  Through the Looking Glass, the idea of interconnectivity is prominent.   Throughout both books, dreams and reality contain similar objects.   The outside world can suddenly be inside, and the non-sensical can have its logic.   By expanding, shrinking, compartmentalizing and/or blending ideas, Carroll illustrates that all perspectives emanate from the same place, and that source is the human imagination where all things - games, animals, plants, minerals and/or people - meld and share a common language.  Language, an expression of human imagination, is the glue that often connects and transmits ideas and imaginings outwardly.   But there are  places in the mind where language is silenced or has    no names,    such as the forest on the way to where Tweedledum and Tweedledee  live, that stay inside.   Through the use of puns, repetitions, made up words, syntax reversals and all sorts of language play, Carroll shows the human imagination can be playful and whimsical, or scary and full of sorrow.   He shows both associative and dissociative tangents.     Dialogue is positioned as a kind of outside language, one heard and responded to by others, a way to interact and engage, but thoughts are given equal weight, forming a kind of inside or secret language (a talking to oneself), which is often in direct opposition to what is spoken aloud.   All of the ways language functions in the stories seem to illustrate the varying (and often oppositional) perspectives possible and they all come from the same source.               Carroll shows that any perspective is possible, that human imagination can create, bend, destroy, or blend.   His tales create impossible worlds, which can push the human mind to new ways of thinking about the world, what reality is or can be, and  all ideas    live in the  same  house."";Intense abstract post modernism????  ;Thanks for your honest critique.   You comments show that a score is dependent on what peers evaluate your work.   I thought my first essay was much better than this and only got a 4.   So that is why I said before that the score doesn't really mean anything.   Critiques are subjective and not all will agree about what is an appropriate marking..;To the other Anon - your note/critique/message above, ""Intense abstract post modernism????,"" is quite cryptic.

I had previously thought about the identity question, but couldn't get a clear enough idea for an essay.   You hit it exactly on the head, I think, especially in the last paragraph with your ideas about what Carroll was asking.;I loved the oxymoron you used, ""playfully serious.""     I enjoyed reading your essay and thesis (I think you are saying that Carroll understood that true education needs both logic and creativity - correct?), but I was confused because I do not understand many of your terms or connections.   For example, what did   ""Ken Robinson's Ted Talk on How School is Killing Creativity?""   argue and how does his argument or theme relate to what you are saying about Carroll's theme in the book?   Since I do not know this talk, I can't understand how it relates to your work. And what is ""The Victorian education system?""   A brief explanation on this concept would have helped me.   Likewise, I would have liked more understanding of what you mean by the term ""lessons""   you state Carroll referred to.   What were the lessons the book gave about politics, mathematics and history?   I For me, your essay would have been more powerful had you been clearer about the concepts and included more direct connections between them.  ;anonymous:  http://www.victorianschool.co.uk/schoolday.html  - this should help explain the Victorian Education system;I got a 5.5 on my first essay.

Yes, the book had an  imaginative premise and strong  central theme but both were almost entirely lost in Mary Shelley's over-wrought and over-written style. Yes, I know it was the Victorian period, but many of the initial reviews of her book even at that time were highly critical. Dracula, as written by Bram Stoker, does not suffer from the same faults and stands the test of time much more gracefully. This book was a chore to slog through. I'll take the Boris Karloff version any day!;This is just an opinion, but Mary Shelley, at eighteen years old, probably already understood more psychology and was a better writer than Stoker coming along seventy years later.     The grand bore of the men of Dracula prefigure the sort of self congratulatory fools that one can find at shooting range with an open bar.     If only the count had been a lttle less well mannered I would have rooted for him.     See....look at what that dreadful Stoker novel did to me.     I sound like one of those guys who talks back to their TV and expects an answer.;I've received high scores in my two essays, but I have advanced degrees which required a great deal of writing. The fact that you have such a small word count means that you need to develop your essay in a concise manner. Here are some ideas:--Learn your grammar rules, especially how to use COMMAS, and the use of singular and plural pronouns (try this: Choosing between singular and plural pronouns for dummies)--Have at least three paragraphs with an introduction, supporting arguments/quotations and a conclusion. You don't need a title, which I saw in a couple of essays. Your thesis should be clearly stated in the first couple of sentences and repeated in a similar form, after you have supported it, in your conclusion. Do not go off on tangents. I have seen this several times, where the essay starts off well and then the rest of the essay has nothing to do with the original thesis. Don't try to cover too many different ideas in an essay of this size, pick one topic and develop it.--Re-read your work OUT LOUD. You will discover that some words are missing or misspelled (saw this is several essays.)--Rewrite several times. I create a draft with my main ideas and in the next couple of days I will add quotes and delete others, tightening the concept as I go.--Remember your audience. These are your peers grading your paper and they might enjoy humor or a personal aside. I loved the comment someone left me that turned my entire thesis on its head and really made me think. That person gave me a high grade for my rationale, but I loved that they had a totally different take on the topic!--Avoid using words that you commonly use in conversation and should be avoided at all costs in critical essays. For example: ""so"" (oy vey, this is SO overused), ""like"" (as in, visualize a Valley Girl speaking), ""you know"", etc.I've had three kids in college (one currently in medical school, one in grad school and one who is a junior) and they were, without a doubt, terrible writers as freshmen. By their senior year, their writing had developed nicely and all three agree that creating a draft and rewriting are the keys to an ""A"" paper. My daughter published a biology research paper in college and that required an entirely different style of writing which was directed at a totally different audience (I could barely understand the abstract.) A few people are naturally talented writers, but for most of us it  requires effort and practice. My brother-in-law is a successful mystery  novelist and you should see how many re-writes his editor has him do  before the novel is ready to go to print. Writing styles vary depending on the topic. Literary criticism is different from technical writing (have you read a Microsoft Word manual lately?), just as a bill in Congress is written differently from the speech that the President (or his speech writer) wrote for the State of the Union. These were all written for a different audience and purpose.It is unfortunate that students in this course can't get direct feedback from the professor because that is how my children learned to write in college, but hopefully some of the reviews will give useful feedback. I do spend time on my reviews, but others may not have the luxury of that available time.;Thank you.  This is great info.  Thanks for sharing. ;In case an example might help, my essay received a 3 for form (which I don't think it deserved) and a 2 for content:  On the surface,  Alice In Wonderland  and  Through the Looking Glass  are playful tales for children:   Alice enters two dream worlds and encounters fantastic characters and events there.   It may seem all in good fun, but the absurdity and fearful situations Alice encounters can be considered metaphors for the existential horror of everyday life.   Consider, for example, the imagery of transformation from animal to human, animate to inanimate, and vice versa, and how in the novels eating is symbolic of the destructiveness inherent in everyday life.For example, cards and chess pieces assume human qualities, then revert back to their inanimate forms, Alice shakes the Red Queen into a kitten, when Alice's neck grows to an absurd length the Pigeon questions whether she is a serpent or a human, and the Duchess' baby morphs into a piglet.   The boundaries among animal, human, and inanimate are flexible and fluid.   Although these transformations are playful, even magical, the constantly shifting categories create an element of existential uncertainty and dread.   When the rules of logic no longer apply, the unpredictability leaves the reader anticipating the next transformation and how the story will unfold, but there is also a sense that, from Alice's perspective the entire scenario could change into something horrific.   To survive in this constantly shifting world, one must master the Mock Turtle's curriculum of ""ambition, distraction, uglification.""   The shifts invite the reader to consider the perspective of characters other than protagonist Alice, including those who become food. The Lobster Quadrille and the Walrus and the Carpenter who danced with, then ate, ""every one"" of the unfortunate lobsters, are emblematic of the constant betrayals lurking below the surface niceties of everyday life.   Beneath the surface, our world, and relationships, are as broken, and as irreparable, as is Humpty Dumpty.   Beneath the surface, the novels are dark fables.   ;How did Harker get away?   Where is it described?;Thanks.   After I finished the book, I was looking for the description.   I think it is a major omission.   The detailed description of h is imprisonment, and plans for escape, the leading up to it, then nothing about how he got from the castle to being nursed by the good sisters.   You would think he would at least have had a conversation with Mina about it.;I was a bit disappointed with the Count, he didn't fight for his live! Moreover, he decided to run away, back to Transylvania!;He who turns and runs away, lives to fight another day.;I found the novel a bit of a bore, and I have a very high tolerance for boredom.     Imagine some hack filtering his world view through the cheap psychology of Dr. Phil while he writes a novel on his TV tray.     That is the Victorian era equivalent we find in Stoker.     No deep insights, bad pacing, very repressed characters (hard to believe he was a fan of Walt Whitman).       Van Helsing should have read more Kierkegard.     I would have found him more believable plowing 40 acres in   Minnesota than playing Socrates to three uptight British gentlemen and an American who fetishises Winchesters.       ;I just...

It is not only on a language level.           I am not sure if schools in every country planting the same structure of written work to the students heads. As a result we have different expectations, and from there we receiving conflicts , misunderstanding and resentmen. That is why this forum and your comments are so important. I really appreciate your help. ;Precious information. Are we have here more teachers from around the world to explain to us exact rules of the academic writing (traditional in their countries )? It will be very helpful ( especially for the grading and establishing more  understanding between fellow classmates). I believe misunderstanding can backfire in both ways. Students, who have a solid knowledge in US writing standards can mark down the work of the people who do not have such a knowledge . In other hand, classmates, who have different values and academic experience , according to this values and experience, can mark down the work of US students . Classic cultural confrontation , as Romans and Barbarians: should you wear pants or you should not? ;This combination of motive sometimes turns into real fights over which country owns  the first version of the folk tale. For Russians Afanasiev's compilation overshadows Grimm's tales.  ;Some great observations here--I teach on the university level (I'm teaching a World Lit class right now and we'll be watching Spirited Away and discussing its influences in a week or two) and I can tell you that at least one Japanese scholar, Ando Satoshi, wrote a journal  article on the connection between Spirited Away and Alice's Adventures  in Wonderland.I also noticed the similarities to the Russian and Slavic Baba Yaga. While researching Spirited Away's roots in Japanese folklore, I found out that there is a Japanese mountain withc/deity who corresponds very closely to the EAstern European Baba Yaga. If you are interested in learning more about Spirited Away and Japanese folklore and mythology, and if you can get access to academic databases, you can check out an article by Thomas Keirstead which will tell you more.;Anyone who's watched the professor's lecture on color symbolism would know that orange is usually meant to represent childhood. This is why the first Disney theme parks were built in Anaheim, California and Orlando, Florida--two traditional sources of oranges. The fact that the marmalade jar was empty foreshadows the loss of innocence accompanied by Alice's maturity. Note her reluctance to part with the jar, even as she clung to the remaining vestiges of a child's experiences. She has already consumed the orange marmalade, unknowingly, through her childhood experiences up to that point. Putting the jar back into a cupboard marks a suspension of her ordinary experience during a journey into adulthood.;but is it marmalade?;Over interpretation is really exist when it  is totally out of the context and comon sence and taken out of the thin air. And unlike the bright idea it is often dull repetition of the popular theme of the day.(for exemple : sexuality everywhere , including "" Alice in Wonderland ""). ;I'll agree with every point you have just made, adding only that children of all ages, once aware of the world and a mis-deed [e.g. they are aware of what right and wrong is on a simple level] can start picking up the 'darker' threads. Peter Pan is very dark, but it is when these stories are made into mainstream quick-media [Disney films, pantomimes, comics* simplified version stories - this is the bad guy - say boo etc, ] that the darkness is transferred into lighter comedy horror - the step-mother is still terrifying but she is obviously the evil character now.*Comics in the sense of a few pages of quick story rather than the actual medium of graphic literature which can be as complex, if not more so, than novella.;Sean - thank you for clarifying the point - I, like anonymous had an issue with this but fully agree with your point.;Yes, thank you, Sean, you expalined that beautifully, especially the part about how your brain is tricked by the illusion the mirror creates. That helps a lot. I think we mean the same thing, the image you see on the back of the paper is the image on the front of the paper if you invert it on the lateral axis, like a mirror does, which again is in the way the image is handled, of course.Mirrors are confusing and I still find them a little creepy sometimes. Maybe my next essay will be about them. Also, since this is a literary forum, can I recommend a short story this reminds me of? It's  'Midnight in the Mirror World', by Fritz Leiber. That spooked the life out of me.;Sean, I suggest you think again about mirrors. Do the following experiment: take a pair of gloves and go stand in front of a mirror; look at the image of your left hand and try to fit one of the gloves to it. You will find that only the right glove fits the image of your left hand. Hence the image of your left hand is indeed a right hand. Mirror image. Note, however, that your thumb stays on the same side with respect to, say, your little finger. That takes care of your faulty argument about direction indicators not being reversed when seen in a rear-view mirror. Finally, ask yourself why in many countries 'Police' or 'Ambulance' is written backwards on the hoods of the corresponding vehicles.;I expect Lewis Carrol would very much enjoy this and would be incredibly proud of causing all the confusion. Do mirrors reverse things? Don't they?   What does it mean if they do, what if they don't? I think the reason he liked the looking glass enough to put it the book is exactly because it messes with people's minds and makes them doubt their logic and reality, not because mirrors reverse, or they don't. This is probably more in the spirit of the books than any kind of analysis really.  ;Sean, why deny the evidence? Chirality comes up all the time in the sciences. In chemistry, mirror image molecules are identical in mass, composition, etc yet one can separate the left- from the right-handed molecules and they often have different reactivities, toxicity, etc. Sean himself is largely made of chiral molecules, as we all are. Try a diet of d-aminoacids and soon there won't be a Sean to deny chirality. You claim your gloves are symmetrical? What an incredibly lame excuse for not doing the simple experiment that would force you to reconsider! I imagine you own a pair of shoes. Pick it up and do as suggested above: you will find that your right shoe fits the image of your left foot. And don't tell me you can't do the experiment because you don't have a full-size mirror... By the way, all this has been worked out a long time ago by the branch of maths called topology. Look it up, focusing on the differences between symmetry with respect to a point and symmetry with respect to a plane. ;Sean, let's not talk about being offensive: this is after all an academic debate and, as such, it should be fierce and merciless. That's because the ante is so small. Therefore, I must take exception with your statement that 'chirality.... does not have anything to do with mirrors'. Chirality results when two of the substituents on an asymmetric carbon atom are switched around, A taking B's place and vice versa, so that the l- and d-isomers are mirror images. Obviously, it is not because they are mirror images that their properties differ; but it is because the two substituents are switched around that they are mirror images. Moreover, much as I love Prof. Rabkin's lectures, I object when he says that Martin Gardner errs when discussing mirrors in his AnAl. Gardner was a mathematician and knew his topology. Gardner was also very critical of the lazy passe-partout literary psycho-babble that sees obvious sexual symbolism in anything elongated (a pencil) or shaded (a grove) or moist (moss on a river bank)... That sort of analysis was perhaps novel and amusing in the 1920's but today it's become the absolute clich  .;Let's see if we can find what we agree on.Alice is standing in front of a mirror. Kitty is to her right. In the mirror, we see MirrorAlice and MirrorKitty. MirrorKitty seems to be to the left of MirrorAlice because the image is flipped. But MirrorKitty is still to the right of actual Alice. So maybe the actual question is, what do you consider 'reverse' to be.Anyway, the reason I started this thread is because Professor Rabkin made no sense to me when he talked about the mirror part, and the left and right part, and I don't mean the good Lewis-Carroll-no-sense way. The both of you are making a lot more sense even with the conversation a little heated.;Ive read through two different essays that are arguing that there is no point to Alice in Wonderland - no deeper meaning, no symbolism, no allegory, no parody - that it is just pure nonsense for the sake of nonsense. Im honestly not sure how to grade them in the content portion. The essays didn't really convince me at all, but I don't want to mark them down just because I don't agree. Im looking for opinions here to see how others would mark them. ;They aren't badly written, but all they made me think of were counterexamples. I think Im struggling with the fact that it is widely agreed that Alice is full of symbolism and social commentary. The essays have similar arguments against that, but they don't make sense. I don't know how to explain what I mean by that without posting a sample, but I don't think that would be fair of me. ;I think I probably looked at one of those too.   I would look at how well written the argument is and if they have clear examples.

For Walton it's how much he longs to conquer the north (yes, we get that, too), how much he loves Victor and so on. For the monster it is how much he wants to belong somewhere, how he wants to get back at Victor and so on. For Victor, it is mostly how desperate he is.

However, the third paragraph was very well written, and it connected the poem he/she was talking about to the novel, albeit in a completely different way. I ended up giving this person a 1 for content. What I want to know is was that the right grade to give, would a 2 have been better?  ;Oh.;I got a 2 for form and 2 for content but the grade they showed was 4.

Please elaborate.;Interesing theory.   She didn't kill them, though, and she was a victim herself, part of the undead, so I see Dracula himself as the main culprit.   Perhaps only women could use children as victims.   Or perhaps she was giving birth to children the only way possible for her.   Had she lived, her victims would have become like her, so her legacy would continue.   Why only the women vampires interested in children victims?

In John Seward's journals, Stoker writes about Renfield, a mentally ill patient who eats living things with the belief that he will absorb their lives. Seward writes that Renfield  ""gave many flies to one spider, and many spiders to one bird, and then wanted a cat to eat the many birds. What would have been his later steps?""  This is in reference to the Darwinian ideas surrounding the survival of the fittest. It is suggested that Renfield might consume the cat, but Seward's curiosity encourages the reader to question the belief that humans are the apex predators of the food chain. If Renfield eats the cat, would another species in the future evolve to eat the human?  Renfield's behaviour is animalistic in nature and runs parallel to Dracula, who behaves in a similar way to achieve sustenance. He consumes living things to survive, the only difference being that he drains the blood from humans. Significantly, when Mina first sees Dracula, she struggles to decipher whether he is  ""man or beast"". Stoker intentionally portrays similar behaviour between the characters in order to imply that they are not that different. This reminds the reader of Darwin's suggestion that humans evolved from Apes.  Stoker later shows Renfield having an attack of conscience as he tries to help save Mina. This contrasts with Dracula   s behaviour as Dracula feels no remorse for his actions. This key difference between the two characters is ultimately what separates man from ""beast"". It poses questions for how the human mind may evolve in the future to account for this possible weakness, suggesting that the idea of humans evolving in to ""beasts"" is plausible. Exactly how different are we from the supernatural monsters so frequently portrayed in literature?Form:peer 1      Interesting paper - I enjoyed reading it. It was well written. Have you thought whether there are any examples in the book that contradict your theory? The thesis that Stoker was influenced by Darwin may be weak - we didn't necessarily gain any insight into how Dracula was created to understand whether he was an evolved human and Renfield's ""evolution"" within the asylum doesn't pay off in the sense he doesn't change completely (not that one would, as it would take generations per Darwin). Also, man, as unevolved, conquers vampire, as evolved, which is directly contrary to Darwin (other than there is a process...).peer 2      Excellent form. Ideas were portrayed clearlypeer 3      Clear, simple structure with ideas flowing logically.

Also, if Darwin was the underlying theme, is the conclusion of the novel that religion, or Christianity, conquers evolution?peer 2      Good parallels and illustrations to strengthen your argumentpeer 3      Interesting ideas with relevant supporting examples. I would have liked this essay to have a longer word limit and so you could develop this topic further!peer 4      This essay is brilliant! I loved the comparison between Renfield and Dracula and I loved the parallel with evolution. I also love the fact that you wrote something about Renfield. We tend to forget him! Very different and insightful!peer 5      While I think your thesis statement is interesting, and one I haven't thought of before in regards to Dracula, I, personally, see several issues with it, specifically in your information. Survival of the fittest is not about the food chain. It means that certain individuals of a specific species are more adapted to a specific environment and thus able to survive while others do not. These survivors breed and pass on those traits to their offspring, strengthening the species for that environment. It's about adaptability, not animals of different species consuming each other as predator and prey. Also, a common misconception is that Darwin claimed humans descended from modern apes. Not true. Claimed apes and humans had a common ape-like ancestor. Like I said, interesting theory, but if you're going to use that argument, should probably do some reading up on Darwin and evolution first. Just my opinion. :)I really appreciated the comments for my essay. I also agree that there are issues with my thesis. If I didn't have a word limit, I would have explored further to include counter arguments etc. I guess I was guilty of trying to find specific things to say (and quotes from the text) in attempts to support my thesis, knowing that I only had up to 320 words. I'd like to write a longer essay on this one I think! Thank you for your comments, you've given me things to think about!;I'm actually really pissed off that I didn't receive a 5 for my essay. I received the lowest mark I've ever had so far. I don't understand how I didn't score a 3 for the form section. ""Use commas when required""...? My essay is rife with commas.Johnathan Harker: A Journey to Manhood The first glimpse of Johnathan Harker shows him as a young man who  has    recently grown into manhood    under the service of Peter Hawkins. It  is evident that he has not yet fully acknowledged this transformation  as he accidentally refers to himself as a solicitor   s clerk. It is  possible that he may not be comfortable in his role as a    full-blown  solicitor    as he feels he needs to grow more in terms of his  experiences. In 19th century London, he has yet to marry and establish himself within his company in order to complete his journey to manhood. Despite being capable of exercising his skills concerning legal  matters, he still portrays the na  vet   and disobedience of a young boy.  This is evident when he ignores the warnings of the locals and also when  he feels a twisted enjoyment when going against the Count   s wishes of  sleeping somewhere other than his designated room. During his time at the castle, he is engaged to Mina. Considering the 19th  century setting it can be assumed that they intend to consummate their  relationship in their marital bed. Mina herself comments in one of her  letters that marriage signifies settling down    soberly into old married [women]   ,  thus acknowledging it as a step to adulthood. Johnathan   s ordeal and  recovery in hospital, his sudden marriage and the death of his dear  friend Peter Hawkins force him into maturity on an emotional and  intellectual level. In addition to this, he feels like a    new man    when  Van Helsing confirms what he experienced to be true. Johnathan transforms from a man who takes directions from others to a  man who takes control of situations and joins the coalition against the  Count. Ancient hunters and young warriors were considered men upon  completion of their first kill. Johnathan shears the Count   s throat,  thus completing his journey to manhood.Grade: 4FORMpeer 1      Very good structure and grammar usage, with slight errors at certain  instances (The first glimpse).

Sorry I don't have any real input for improvement.peer 5     This is  satisfactory analysis of the student's chosen topic. ;Essay: Vampires have the power to change you into one of them, and when     that happens, you lose who you are and become something monstrous. Another     way to lose your sense of self is by going mad. A homicidal maniac is another     type of monster. The affliction of madness comes up a few different times     in Dracula, and shows us the dangers of being a fanatic. Jonathan's temporary insanity is caused by fear. He is afraid that what     he saw could not have happened. He is afraid that he does not understand     how the world works after all. His fear goes deeper though, into the Problem     of Evil. How can a devout man reconcile the presence of such evil creatures     as those he saw, and at the same time believe in a God who would never     allow such a creature to exist? He cannot wrap his mind around the question     because he cannot let go of either belief. It is that which makes him go     mad. The mental patient Renfield has clearly been bitten. He eats increasingly     larger animals to sustain himself because he cannot bring himself to bite     a human. His crisis is one of spirituality as well. He cannot bite a human     victim for fear of mortal soul, but cannot release the vampire's hold on     him either. Renfield prays to Dracula,""I am here to do your bidding, Master...     and you will not pass me by, will you, dear Master, in your distribution     of good things?""(112). Here, he is asking for the assurance of immortality     that in his mind will save his soul since he feels he is lost to God. In both cases, the allusions to Christianity and fanaticism are present.     Stoker uses madness to caution against being too ridgid in your beliefs.     It is a lesson that would have been scandalous in Victorian Europe, which     is why it is hidden in symbolism rather than overt. Form: peer 1     You have raised different line of thought at the same time,     although you try to centralize on madness but unfortunately you couldn   t     powerfully reinforced this. peer 2     Good vocabulary and grammar. You should     think carefully about the purpose of each word and sentence and verify     if they are connected to the rest of the essay. in the last paragraph you     say: ""Stoker uses madness to caution against being too ridgid in your beliefs.""     but you didnt explore the issue of ""rigid belifs"" previously. peer 3         The structure is not fully clear to me. This e.g. concerns the reference     to christianity. peer 4     The student makes good use of grammar, punctuation     and references to the text. Although be careful of your spelling (""ridgid""     when it should be rigid). peer 5     Fairly strong essay in grammar and structure.Content: peer 1     Following your line of argument, you have deep understanding     of the work and your line of argument is valid but you couldn   t just deliver     it persuasively peer 2     I enjoyed that you brought up the issue of madness,     its an amazing topic.But I had difficulty to compare/contrast the madness     of Johnathan and the mental patient Renfield. peer 3     Interesting idea.     During the text you develop the link of various aspects in a nice way.     Maybe the Essay could be improved if you further lmit it to one element.     peer 4     Relating madness to one's beliefs makes for an interesting thesis.     Well done. peer 5     Point made about Jonathan's temporary insanity being     tied to his inability to rationalize how God would allow such evil to exist     is rather juvenile.;So far nobody could tell I am not a native... I'm proud of it.;I take it all with a grain of salt.    How many folks here are in the habit of grading other people's work?

During the day, like right now, I'm supposed to be writing reviews that impact what my associates are actually earning for their living.

I don't necessarily expect to learn from other people's comments on my work.   If I happen to get an interesting comment from a particularly good grader, that's just an added bonus.-anitra;I have also been really disappointed with the peer reviews. Perhaps I was looking forward to them too much. I do think that some things can be learned from them, but I am beginning to change my mind about the students giving marks. For one thing, there has been a ton of discussion about HOW to give marks, and how to give the correct percentages, and not being able to mark a 0 even if an essay is plagiarized or has nothing to do with the topic.....I mean, no offense to the Professor, but I have seen a lot more effective systems in other MOOCs.

I was trying to inject some levity with my post. And if you read Game of Thrones, you learn that weakness is not simply physical, mental, or economic prowess, sometimes it boils down to those who have a high opinion of themselves and are downright cruel. And at least to an American like me, it's always about competition. We see five different examples of writing. If you use that as your spectrum of skill, that makes the grading competitive. Let's all use some of George R. R. Martin's wise words to guide us as we finish up this class: ""You know nothing, Jon Snow [or insert your name]."" ;I have a problem, I am not a native speaker.

Also, although the verb tenses agree, the sentence structure is grammatically incorrect apart from the word usage you pointed out. I would hazard a guess too, that the phrase this reviewer used was something he or she picked up somewhere, and thought it made him or her sound academically literate. Of course, it only serves the opposite purpose when one is not even proficient writing simple sentences. I can't comment on the terseness and simplicity suggestion because I haven't read your essay; but if it makes you feel any better, I once applied terminology by using the expression 'dual opposites' to convey the idea of twofold oppositions, and got the same reaction.           ;I didn't get a chance to read all of the comments above (there are a lot of them!), but generally, I agree with your frustrations. I was very, very displeased with the reviewers comments for my first essay because three of the four did not say ANYTHING about what I did well.   Like someone else pointed out, the professor states that we should provide constructive criticism AND include something that the writer did well.   On that particular essay, I was criticized for using the passive voice, when in fact, I was using the active voice! I can't remember the exact sentence that was used by the reviewer to make his point, but the sentence was written in active voice, and I think it was written in the present progressive tense. This must have confused the reviewer. It just really bothers me to be criticized for doing something wrong when I know it wasn't wrong. Plus, like others mentioned, it's difficult to swallow some of these reviews not knowing what kind of credentials these fellow students have. No offense to the very young fellow students in this class, but I don't see how a 12-year-old is going to be able to assess me on my grammatical structure. I think it's great that individuals this young are embarking on this educational journey, so I don't mean to be rude in this regard. I would feel much differently if I knew a professor was the one grading my essays.;In my essay on Dracula by Bram Stoker,   I tried to look at the novel and the author's motivation in a new light.   I'm sure most of you have heard   the different themes, symbols, etc. that have been discussed over the years.   The fear and desire, attraction and repulsion, the sexuality...the list goes on and on.   In looking at the novel as a good horror story and considering that perhaps that was the intention of the author, I apparently hit a nerve with some people.   To answer the question, have you read the book - yes, several times.   I thought that this class was about writing to enlighten our peers and, while I may not be a very good writer, I do try to look at these stories in a new way.    In response to the comment that I shouldn't discuss non-literary topics - I wasn't aware that discussing the possibility that Dracula was just a  really good horror story written by an imaginative man from bits and pieces he probably gathered during his travels was discussing a non-literary topic.    I do understand that many of you may be more experienced in writing these essays, but let me remind you that some of us are 54 years old and due to circumstances were not able to attend college.   I am here to learn but I don't think commenting that an essay is ""...not entertaining or provocative...it is lackluster."" is very helpful to the writer.   This is especially so as no suggestions were made that might have been helpful.For those of you that did make suggestions on how to improve the essay, thank you very much.;Unless you've seen Farscape, you may not get this (I do it not to offend those sensitive to true profanity), but:Frell'em.

I know in my last essay on Frankenstein I was told that abortion is a mordern issue and should not have been used. However, abortion did exist in the 1800s. It was viewed as socially unacceptable, however it was there. So to say mentioning abortion when discussing the parent child relationship between characters in Frankenstein  is not a modern view. I think an open dialogue could have cleared up that assumption and help with future issues like plagerism questions or concerns. A lot of poeple seem to be having issues with the peer evaluations.  ;I get tired of people who don't read the entire piece it seems. For instance, I said ""This is reason some women seek out abortions, because they do not wish to bring a child into the world"". Then went on to say that is the core reason behind Frankenstein destorying the second creature and places him in the role of a mother in relationship to the creatures. I had one reviewer who said it was a weak argument even if it was relevant because there are many reasons for abortions. There are, but that is why I used the word some and, in the context of the argument, that is the one that fits because the essay was about parent-child relationships NOT abortion. It was just one aspect.

I can accept multiple theses or a multi-part thesis, but if there isn't some sort of unifying statement, the whole thing just rambles.

So many I read that don't have one are unfocused.   Plus, the way I was taught in school, for it to be an essay it has to have a thesis.   The Work Expectations page does say something about this. It says ""using those notes and reviewing the work, we can come to a hypothesis about what that significance might be.""   The stuff on the actual peer review page talks about whether the argument is persuasive and if it is well supported.

Shelley motivates her characters beyond every writer that I have encountered so far.Shelley devotes the first three chapters, 67 pages (twenty percent of the book,) to characterizing Victor by depicting the circumstances that shaped his character.As for technique, Shelley motivatesa. In layers: if an action of Victor   s father was crucial in motivating Victor, Shelley also gives the father   s motivations, and sometimes more layers. For example: Shelley provides motivation on why Victor   s mother adopted Elizabeth: because she had endured poverty and was relieved out of it by Victor's father marrying her. Shelley motivates beyond that and tells us why she was in poverty, why Victor's father married her, and again in another level, her father's misfortune in his merchant career, and also Elizabeth   s history.  b.  By multiple reasons: Shelley doesn   t stop if she provided one reason for an action. She gives reasons until we would be surprised if the action didn   t happen. For example: When Elizabeth is adopted into Victor's family, Shelley gives three motivations for Victor   s lack of sibling rivalry: 1. He is showered, and always was, with parental love. 2. Elizabeth is extraordinarily kind. 3. His mother gives her to him as a present, his own to love and cherish. This pattern repeats for every action that Shelley motivates.  c.  Using mini-stories: such as the story of the merchant who was the father of Victor   s mother. These mini-stories have their beginning, middle, and end, with a flavor of oral fairy tales. They deliver stand-alone pleasures adding to the overall impact.In my view, the mini-story technique with its added pleasures, presents a crucial element in propelling the extensive, multi-reason, multi-layer motivating pages Shelley provides.;   Frankenstein   , its numerous imitations and parodies, filmic adaptations, all depicting a hideous and grotesque creature of disproportioned stature, forcing the readers into a state of exciting fear surely establishes it as a novel of horror genre. But at the same time, it gives certain critical messages in a subtle and cunning way.It expresses the status of women writers in that period. The fact that Mary Shelley chose three narrators for the story telling and all of them being male; the passive women characters; our notions about them being moulded by the perceptions of the    male    narrators and finally Victor creating the    creature    without the involvement of women; all point towards the fact that women were unrepresented or underrepresented in the literary society of that period in which intellectual was synonymous with men and women were meant to be the angels at home.Moreover, women not being involving in the creation might be a reaction to Erasmus Darwin who blamed women for all monstrous births.It also shows what happens when science crosses its limits and men break the laws of nature to become gods (creators). Men make discoveries and inventions, leading to uncontrollable applications which turn disastrous.Again, in a less visible manner the story displays the ill effects of extreme ambition and lack of patience. Had Victor been patient in creating the creature using proper body parts, he would not have been a monster (   As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my first intention, to make the being of a gigantic stature   ). Although Victor apparently wanted to be a benefactor, he was always concerned about his own glory and thought him of more ability than he actually was (  _first success to permit me to doubt of my    ability    to give life  _).To sum it all,    Frankenstein    is a wonderful novel with meaningful messages.FORMpeer 1      You have satisfactory structure and you are able to support your arguments. Though, you have some grammatical mistakes and it would be better if you had done some research and had used references.peer 2      There are some sentences with structure problems, e.g. ""   Frankenstein   , its numerous imitations and parodies, filmic adaptations, all depicting a hideous and grotesque creature of disproportioned stature, forcing the readers into a state of exciting fear surely establishes it as a novel of horror genre"" - this sentences needs to be broken into at least 2 to be less confusing or to have a more accurate punctuation. Another example ""Moreover, women not being involving [involved] in the creation"" In general, the ideas are comprehensible and the author shows a good use of vocabulary, connectors and grammar.peer 3      The first sentence doesn't make sense. To establish a book as a novel of horror genre, you don't need numerous imitations and parodies. Maybe, you were trying to say something else. Anyway, I think the structure and the grammar are good.peer 4      A few grammatical errors; you divide your essay into logical, effective paragraphs. However, I could not find an overarching thesis or argument in your essay, so while your divisions between topics were clear, your paragraphs did not relate to a specific argument/goal.peer 5      Although it was nice that your paragraphs weren't blocky, I think some of the sentences should have been incorporated into their own paragraphs rather than standing alone. I would also be careful with ending paragraphs with a quote instead of analysis.CONTENTpeer 1      Your first idea about passive women is a very interesting topic. I would advise you to fathom this concept more, instead of trying to discuss a new topic, as you are doing after the first two paragraphs.peer 2      The main point is compelling and it makes for an interesting idea. However, last paragraph and conclusion seem unrelated to the main topic. In such a short essay it is not very recommendable to have various topics. It could be much productive and convincing to stick to one main argument.peer 3      I find it interesting that Shelley used only men as narrators, and it's a good point. The passive nature of women, the limits of science, and the ill effect of ambition, are all hidden inside the novel. But your essay could be better if it was aiming only on one theme.peer 4      In all of your paragraphs/subtopics, you make valid and effective arguments; however, your lacking a single theme overall for your essay prevents these different areas of interest from coming together into a logical argument. While the reader's understanding of the novel is enriched by your essay, your essay itself lacks a ""point"".peer 5      While you touched on a lot of interesting topics, I think you could strengthen your essay by narrowing your focus onto one topic and examining it in detail. I would also caution against using your subjective opinion about the novel in a literary essay.TOTAL 3;I found the parent-child relationships, specifically along the lines of abandonment, in  Frankenstein. This is shown in more ways than just the abandonment of the creature by Victor. Justine   s mother abandons her, while Elizabeth   s mother dies and her father leaves her with an uncle. In relation the creature, he feels like Victor, who can be seen as God or his father, has abandoned him. This leaves the creature to learn and develop without any guidance or teachings to help in determining how to properly interact with people or what is right and wrong. Victor consistently neglects his responsibility to love and protect his child-creature. This is the first instance of rejection the creature experiences. Each one the follows increases his anger and pain. It also serves to remind him of the first rejection, the rejection of his father and creator, and he does not understand the proper way to wrestle with these emotions. When Victor chooses to destroy the bride, the only companion the creature feels could possibly accept him, it is not different than an abortion. It is the destruction of life, or the potential life, before    birth   . This reinforces the idea that it is a parent-child relationship. While there are times when God in the Bible has destroyed his creations, it always based on the sins of those involved. In Victor   s case, he does not want to bring another creature into the world. This is reason some women seek out abortions, because they do not wish to bring a child into the world and raise it. Given his history, it is doubtful Victor would have treated this one any differently. The pain the first creation feels can then be seen as much more than just the loss of a companion. It was the loss of a sister, the loss of family. This would be even more painful given the fact it was his own   father that destroyed her.  ;This is my latest effort. What I found interesting was the peer reviews, the shortest I've received yet. Peer 1 and peer 3 only wrote in the last box. If they are this short now, I wonder what they'll be like by the time of the Doctorow book!Any comments on the essay would be appreciated :)HMary Shelley wrote  Frankenstein  as a clever allegory of the French Revolution, the event that caused a seismic shift in the intellectual culture of England. It was the French Revolution that had had a profound influence of her parents, the philosopher William Godwin and feminist writer Mary Wollstonecraft, who had lived through the Revolution's hopes and despairs, and who had written powerful social commentaries on the events on the continent. The novel can be seen as a homage to their beliefs.The main events in  Frankenstein  mirror the circumstances of the Revolution. Before the creation of the Being/Revolution, there was a period of enlightenment and intellectual struggle against old traditional belief systems, best seen in the novel by Frankenstein's time at university. Victor Frankenstein represents reformers who were swept along by the revolutionary events. Initial there is a period of fear for the future and for many a worry of going too far, as when Frankenstein ran from the monster that he had created. As with the revolutionaries Danton and Robespierre, he saw the dangers of the forces he had unleashed. Yet, as Robespierre was to become tyrannical in creating the Terror, so Frankenstein, in his destruction of the Being's half-constructed partner, also acted repressively, which caused a wave of violence that destroyed all that was close to him.In the end, the ideals of the Revolution burnt out, with France, and much of the rest of Europe, returning to the traditionalist fold. Similarly, the Being ends its life, going to the northern wastelands, saying 'soon these burning miseries will be extinct. I shall ascent my funeral pile triumphantly...the light of that conflagration will fade away'. The novel ends with the words 'lost in darkness and distance', representing a loss of the ideals of the Revolution, itself an Enlightenment-created monster.M. Shelley,  Frankenstein  (London, 1818)R.

It looks as if I need to be more careful with my typing, or at least proof-read it properly next time.I also appreciate what you say about the contents. You are right of course. :);Unfortunately it only got 4.5...next time! It was fun doing it though :);Academic works oftentimes use footnotes, end notes and a bibliography (sometimes one or two or all of them, depending on the work) and the works cited box doesn't specify bibliography only, so I don't see a problem with it, but I'm not 100% sure.   ;I feel the same way. One of my reviewers said that I relied on quotes too much when I only used THREE. I feel like there's no pleasing people. If I use quotes, I rely on them too much. If I don't, then I get marked down for not using them. And another reviewer said that my theme was ""shallow"". I'm so sorry my theme wasn't all ~deep and meaningful~ for you. Just because you don't resonate with my theme it doesn't mean that you should mark me down for it.;I agree. This was my first essay, I did not write any before because I was pretty busy, but I am genuinely thrilled with comments, both positive and negative. It really helped a lot and I can see the points made and where I went wrong in my writing.  I would also like to say I am sorry if my own assessments were ""lazy"" or too short, I really did everything in a very short time because I did not want to miss the opportunity to continue with this course. Next time, I will try to do better.  Also, one of the comments was regarding my lack of quotations. I read the book in my native language and , as I stated before, had really little time to write the essay. Finding exact quotations and incorporating them in the text would have taken more time that I had on my hands. I will also try to improve that part.  To the anon above: I too got one comment about my essay being somewhat shallow. Lacking depth. It is truly weird, because I gave it a lot of thought. Sure, it lacked structure and my thesis was introduced too late but that does not make it shallow.  I really find it difficult to say all I want to say with 320 words limitation. I know the reasons for the limit, but I do not agree with them. 500 words would be just fine.  ;I understand why some might think citations are needed. What is apparent and obvious to you, might not be apparent and obvious to me. Thus, you cite the part that you are writing about so that everything would be transparent.  On the other hand, it is much accentuated that we are writing for intelligent and attentive student, and we ALL read the same book. It should be apparent   what we are talking about. Especially when we are writing a 320 words essay, not a 30 pages thesis.;I just find it funny that my essay was considered ""shallow"" when I related how the creation appeared to be a monster on the outside and how Victor was a monster on the inside, and how this led to him abandoning his philosophy. What... do you expect me to relate it to Freud or Christianity or some-sh*t?;Yeah, I thought about it. Of course, it would have to take place later, after the course is done because I have another course going.  Cool blogs, both of you. :);Lorem Ipsum,   that's what I might as well type to fill in the 320 words for the next essay.I think I've about had it with this peer review nonsense.   ;I'm mostly getting 4's so no complaints there but the comments are arbitrary, contradictory and sometimes ignorant.    I get the feeling that there are a lot of unemployed literature majors out there who are acting out their frustrations on our hapless little essays.;Care to share some of the comments so we know what to avoid? :P;The type of comment I find the most frustrating are those that say I didn't explore the topic thoroughly enough, that my topic had a lot of potential if I would have written more extensively,    seemingly oblivious to the 320-word limit.   ;I hold my hands up and say that if I think there isn't much depth / exploration but I often substantiate what I say by saying that I would like to read more or that I understand the limitations of the word limit.  ;Professor Rabkin, I'm getting pretty tired of my ""peers"" telling me I've made several spelling mistakes and grading me down, when in fact it is they who are ignorant to the differences between ""real"" English and their American-style English. What makes this especially disturbing is that the book Frankenstein was written using English English. So they can see it's valid, they just choose to play ignorant.  This is not the first time this has happened and it has been brought up before in the forums by others. It's time for clearer guidelines, please.   Thank you;Go to Google and put this in your search bar: differences between english english and american english. You will find several sites. What Americans need to remember is that they did not invent English. It was around way before Americans came along. If anything would be wrong it would be the Americanized English, not my British English. ;If you have nothing constructive to add, please go elsewhere. ;Javier, as a life-long American I am charmed by your naivete.     Sad fact is, most Americans are idiots, and furthermore, they are proud of it.;Detroit.     I was hoping we'd do some post-apocalyptic fictions in this course, but instead, the message boards will have to serve.;Javier, now wonder you are being voted down: ""The USA is the current superpower, so they call the shots"" - really? Is that your argument? There is no need of being condescending and argue a valid point by using these erroneous and unproven assumptions.If you have a personal distaste for the British form of the language, that's just that, a personal preference. There is no need to post comments that are offensive to the rest of the coursera community, a world community where peers from USA have no preferential treatment.;Wow, as a ""Latin American"" I am glad you have no such empire :);Mi estimado Javier, te escribo desde mi Post ""May you evaluate my Grammar?""Estas cuestiones de los idiomas luego se vuelve medio complejo caray.

Spelling is clearly not a black & white issue but a rich tapestry of variegated grays (greys). I really don't mind whether people use color or colour in their essays - they are both valid spellings - although around 20 years ago in a completely different online context (a MUSH - remember those??) I was fairly amused to be insistently told that flourescent was the American spelling of fluorescent (I suspect I might get the same story from many English people !). ;I am lucky to have not encountered this (yet!) but I can totally understand your frustration.

Judging by your English not much. The only one that can change anything here is Prof. Rabkin, so of course I'm trying to get his attention. Every week he puts out video messages. It wouldn't be very difficult for him to add that people are not to judge British English. Now stop trying to cause drama by twisting my thread. Go stalk someone else.;No, he's my teacher. And he won't need my paper to see that there is a problem. It is a general problem not a specific one.

My peers are expected to be at a level of English that they know the difference. The standard is not your average American, it is whatever English your are being asked to read. Since the book Frankenstein was written in British English, and my peers supposedly have read the book as expected, how can they justify telling me my English is wrong when they just read a whole book in British English. Seems very discriminatory to me. Anyway, thanks again for your suggestion. ;This is a literature class but again you have to look at the demographic. They may have read a book in British English, however they may not understand that is the way you write so when they see it outside quotes they take it as typos. Plus, although this is supposed to be higher learning, there are a wide range of ages and professions. Not everyone may have taken a college English class years while others may be about the start their fifth one. I disagree with the standard being set by the book. I do type grey rather gray even though I grew up in US. I am not going to change that because the novel uses a different form. However, I do not expect someone to change their spelling and writing style to fit a BrE text either.  ;I agree with your thought process. I just don't agree with the concept of what you are saying. As a British English speaking literature student, I know there are other types of English out there, so I don't judge either way. It may mean more work for me to check whether my American peers are misspelling or not, but that's only fair. Since this is an advanced undergraduate course (says so in the recommended background part of the course description), my peers should already know these differences. If they don't know this, then they took this course without complying with the requirements of the course, namely being of an advanced undergraduate level. Why should my grades suffer for that. ;Este Post estuvo un poco intenso. Demasiadas pasiones se desataron, demasiados detalles personales.

In my area, one of the major pages was the subject of a back-and-forth war over the inclusion of one paper. It was a real crowd pleaser, in a good journal and quite subversive (against the established theories) so it made the news. I'm a world-expert in the area but I was editing anonymously (for my own reasons) and suggested caution and inclusion but with a proviso of a requirement for validation. My edits were repeatedly removed and eventually dismissed as the ravings of a bitter student (!) by a senior WikiP 'priest' (it is in a good journal so it must be right) - so I gave up. A year later, the whole paper was discredited as experimentally flawed and retracted under a bit of a scandal of fraud (hence this anonymity now because it is still sensitive). It is still included there in WikiP though!!! So - WikiP is great, I use it myself extensively. It is usually better than expected if you look in an area where you are an expert - I am not knocking Wikipedia, it has become the Encyclopaedia Galactica.  If you had read that entry at a time with my cautious view though, you might have got a different opinion of the paper than when it was 'corrected' by the authorised but actually quite (understandably) naive wiki-staff. Stuff in Wikipedia changes over time. If however, you quote the original references - then people can make up their own minds. It is not dishonest because Wikipedia is not original research and is usually a Frankenstein of opinions (which is usually a good thing because it is self regulating to an extent). However, beware pages that have lots of edits in their history because you may be sampling one battle in a wiki war - and my experience is that wiki wars are won by the people with most time - not most knowledge. Yes - you should read the original if you can, there is much too much 'apostolic referencing' going on in general - you can actually track it by inherited mistakes in references (fun to do). -sermon ends- ;I really thought we could go through this fast:};you can only use 410=(4x4)-(4!/4)as for 11, can't think of anything...;It's written that 4.4 might be used, but only 4 included11=44/(sqrt(4x4));34=4!+(4!/4)+438=44-(4!/4)I believe we might not be able to use square.

I really wouldn't say it is boring. Hard and mostly more academic is correct. The courses are of varying quality but it is improving. I like the History and Art History courses. ;My take is that Wells, who was a Socialist and a member of the Fabian Society (they wouldn't have believed in 'revolutionary change' but a kind of languid change over time) was in fact writing a satire in The Invisible Man not of Science per se, but the Individual against society.     It takes a village to subdue Griffin.     Also, this is a kind of inversion of the Judeo-Christian ethic, with the corporeal becoming incorporeal instead of vice versa.     Griffin is the opposite of the Christ-God, because he dies for his own sins, not for the sins of the community.     He is a kind of negative sacrifice.     The Reign of Terror that Griffin threatens to invoke is meaningful in this context, and I believe refers to Robespierre and the French Revolution, that product of the Age of Reason gone terribly wrong.     People can be just as fanatic and religous about science and reason as they can about religion.     I think Wells loved Science, but you also get the feeling reading these works that he was terrified of a Science unchecked by Ethics (vivisection in both Moreau and the Invisible Man, Moreau and Griffin operating out of culturally sanctioned bounds in both novels etc).     As an aside, what I love about Wells is that you can tell he loves the 'little people'.     The bumpkins and workmen etc.     Griffin despises them.;M. Gonzalez, I think you are right not to trust anonymous posts - I don't think Coursera should allow them.     This kind of ties into the Invisible Man, because anonymity is a sort of invisibility on the internet.       Folks who post anonymously tend to be the ones the most abusive of netiquette.     As for me, I have no nefarious purposes.     I'm trying to use Suaron's ring to do good!       Speaking of which, Plato's dialog on the Ring of Gyges is very relevant to this story and The Lord of the Rings.;In my essay which I just submitted I try to make the case that Griffin is merely an antagonist - the real protagonist/hero of the novel is the people with Kemp as a kind of stand-in.;Both writers and reviewers are evolving.  ;@Poulomi: we also have Yama, the Indian/Hindu version of Hades. But death is far truer than them. They are the snakes but death is the venom which makes them what they are.@Javier: Life can be taken by anyone, even lifeless things like an electric shock c;Edgar Allan Poe integrates hints of terror into his novels. The novel  Black cat  has associations with demons and witchcraft; makes you question where the origins of evil dwell.     Firstly, the cat is demonic. The cats, especially black, are the familiars of witches. Also, its name Pluto relates to the antique god of the underworld. The cat provokes ill     temper, while changing person   s character. Still for the longest time (of all animals) tenderness towards Pluto remains     as a contract between human and devil, whilst devil is nourished with evil deeds,  pet stays affectionate to its owner, but once it is offended,  sets the  fire in the house. So, the cat might be a cause of events.     Also, there might be a presumption that man himself was transforming into devil, while the cat was only a catalyst. This transformation required for the bigger sins     murder of loved ones, which only started with Pluto. Taking out an eye, can be associated to the cat   s night vision, which is almost as seeing other world of impurities,  intimidates main character, that his evil side might be detected.     What is more, the cat has clear relation with the wife. The second cat has spot on fur, and wife   s white hair reminds of it, provokes further evilness. The white itself is ghostly color, or maybe because of its relation to purity, and sense of the need to taint it. When the wife is buried in the cellar the cat disappears. It reappears only when the remains are found, as if linked to the body. Also, wife defends pet with bare hand against axe, and is not offended by ill- temper of her husband, raises suspicion that she might have deeper relations to the causes     the cat and the demons.   We reach few conclusions - either the cat is the cause of demonic behavior, the wife is a witch, either the man is at fault.  FORM:peer 1      I've had to give you a 1 for Form because there were quite a few grammatical errors. The main one is that you often miss out 'the', 'a', 'its', 'his' or 'her' before nouns (e.g. in the fourth paragraph, it should be ""THE second cat has a spot on ITS fur""). Sometimes you're using them but most of the time you miss them out. If you worked on this, it would make a big difference to the essay. There were a couple of other minor errors - in the last sentence you used 'either...either'. It should be 'either...or...' (so ""the wife is a witch OR the man is at fault""). Your vocabulary was good.peer 3      Good attempt however there were quite a few grammatical and vocabulary errors. I think you need a stronger conclusion.peer 4      Several grammar mistakes hinders the clarity of your essay quite significantly. You are missing some small words in sentences, improper placement of commas, or misusing words to name a few.Content:peer 1      You could have expanded your conclusion more but apart from this you had a lot of interesting ideas and managed to fit quite a lot in to your essay. You noticed quite a range of symbolism from even just the cat character. I've given you a 2 for Content.peer 3      I like that you chose to discuss evil however in some parts the argument seemed lost, I feel you might have focused too much on analyzing one story that your examples or motivation for choosing this topic was not as clear. I would suggest that you use Evil as the underlying theme and then look for strong examples from multiple stories to support it, perhaps the absence of Faith in the characters is what creates Evil?peer 4      Your conclusion is obscure, it does not relate back to your thesis. However, I think your content is actually quite good, nice depth in analysis.Total score: 3;I appreciate that you guys read it, even if it is graded lower. The thought about witch got my own attention, which was basically keeping me writing this essay:D;Thank you for corrections, it would be hard to use it for essay, because I barely made through word count. If I had to chose one interpretation, I would chose the most boring one - only about cat itself. How could I not share wife being a witch ( which is a weak interpretation on its own)? If I'm able to see several interpretations why not sharing it.;As for peer 3, I couldn't add more stories because structure now quite logical, one conclusion about origins of evil per paragraph. And I was highly motivated for this topic, because I write fiction myself in related topic.;Nature as the personification of 'woman,' as with Mother Nature (something to be controlled and penetrating its secrets)) - never thought about that! I have to agree with peer 1 and 4, and personally, to me, it sounds like peer 3 is simply jealous. Well done!  ;Once upon a MOOC I pondered, on a unit my mind wandered,Over many tale of death and love by Hawthorne and by PoeThus my brain was split in pieces, searching for a worthy thesis,Searching with an effort ceaseless, ceaseless on a thesis to bestowEnriching value to enhance the readings Rabkin did bestowUpon a peer I do not know.Most distinctly I espy, in readings of this hot July,The threads of death and love entwined with cautionary woeAnd at the center of the haulage, some proud scholar of life   s collegeSeeking for forbidden knowledge, knowledge costly to bestowSeeking knowledge at the cost of death and lost love to bestowThe right to think and feel and know.Rappaccini had a daughter, and in botany he taught her,In a garden whence she saw a neighbor   s window from below  The old man for science daring, set his plans upon a pairingMade the young man to be caring, caring to become her beauMade the poisoned maid bestow her curse upon the stricken beauWhich caused the maiden   s death and woe.The painter of an oval portrait was a man, as Poe reports it,Newly married but toward art alone allows his passions flowAs he crafts an imitation, using his imaginationThere   s a costly limitation to his new bride   s vital glowThere   s a fatal draining, draining of her young life   s vital glowDue to her artwork-blinded beauWithin these tales of knowledge sought, and prices at which art is boughtThe women die and men mourn for their Beatrice or LenoreThis conclusion I   m proposing, at the beach where I   m composingSurely didn   t catch you dozing, dozing on a summer shoreSurely didn   t catch you reading poetry on a beachy summer shoreQuoth the Rabkin,    Nevermore!

But a sneaking suspition that you are making fun of me, too. Genius or cheat? This is the question. Therefore: 1 or 3 (no matter for 2). Guess what I grade?peer 2      Good job on form - no big errors. Intro, middle and conclusion were there. A couple of issues with your rhyming scheme (number of syllables), but really nice poem :)peer 3      A poem was an interesting choice to convey your message. It was well done, better than I could ever do. You did good with both rhyme and meter. It wasn't an essay, but it was still grammatically correct.peer 4      Perfect, just perfect! I am totally impressed!CONTENT  peer 1      The matter of the Unit 5 is not delved into. You stay at the surface of the tales. You have not analyzed in depth any argument of the stories. You only named a couple of titles and made a summary of respective plots.peer 2      Your poem was lovely, but it did make it a bit harder to find the thesis. You did a good job considering your self-imposed constraints, but I think you could have had a meatier argument if you'd written an essay.peer 3      You didn't really add many thoughts beyond summaries of a couple of stories. There wasn't an in-depth analysis of any work, and you seemed to write mostly about the reading process in general.peer 4      Best essay EVER!!! Hooray! I wish I could give you more than a 3! You made my day!COMMENTSpeer 2      I really enjoyed your poem.peer 4      Thank you! I am glad I have stuck with this course this long so I had the joy of reading your poem![nb: I couldn't do this one in prose after reading Poe's inspiring poetry.];Thanks. I could have put in a couple more hours to get the meter and rhyme scheme just so, but it seemed at that point like diminishing returns of an investment of time and effort.

Because you ask this frequently. You are damned by the very thought that you are mad. It is not me whom you are asking it; you doubt and question yourself.  Again you hear things in heaven, earth and hell. The disease which has sharpened your senses is    madness   .  How! How! Didn   t I tell the story healthily and calmly?  So, you think, telling a story calmly makes you sane. And killing a man calmly and quietly hides your insanity. Are you trying to fool me? You killed an old man just because of what appears to be a cataract. Or was it his gold that compelled you?  No, no! It was not the old man who vexed me, but his Evil Eye.  You consider the old mad and his eye as two discrete identities. And you are sane?  Didn   t you notice with what dexterity I committed the crime? Can a madman do this?    You are whimsical!  You think you are omniscient. How could you know what an old man thinks from a mere groan? You just empathetically attach it with your own feelings. And why are you troubled many a night, just at midnight, when all the world sleeps?  You thought the neighbours would hear his heart but you yourself yelled while attacking? Is it the perfect way of doing a crime? The only thing you wanted was him to look at you, with his eye so that your blood would run cold and you could do a cold blooded murder.  Don   t mock me. I must scream or die! And now again!     hark! Louder! Louder! Louder! Louder!-  It   s not his heart that you listen, it   s yours. It   s your guilt that needs confession. In the     Tale Tell heart    it   s your heart that is telling the story. The old man is dead, stone dead.         peer 3      Last paragraph: ""you hear"", not ""you listen"". Glad you made the mistake as it made the essay more your own.  peer 4      Accurately and clearly written - an interesting pastiche of Poe.  peer 5      I'm not exactly sure how to rate your essay. It does not meet the expectations of an academic essay, and yet, I can't help to recognize the brilliance of your stream of consciousness commentary. I am a fiction writer myself, so I understand how much effort you must have put into this work. As a consequence, I like to honor writer's attempts to step outside of the box, so I'll give you a ""3"" for form.  peer 6      I couldn't find grammar mistakes.      peer 1      I am sorry, but I don't understand exactly what you want to tell us with your essay; how do we understand that the narrator is insane and unreliable? You don't show us that.  peer 2      Maybe, for you, there are a shadowing idea somewhere between your words, but I'm really sorry, i couldn't find it. and there are not connections between your words. the approach of madness doesn't fit.  peer 3      I'm not sure where Poe leaves off and you begin!  peer 4      The dialogue is amusing but not necessarily convincing; the non-Poe line of thought does not fully create a line of argument that persuades this reader.  peer 5      Again, I'm not sure how to score your content because you've done something entirely different than any other writer I've read during this course. You present some very good ideas towards the end of the essay. However, the first 2/3rds of the essay feels to me like all form and no substance other than establishing that you're writing a stream of consciousness commentary. The meat of the essay begins with ""You think you are omniscient. How could you know what an old man thinks from a mere groan? You just empathetically attach it with your own feelings."" As a result, I'm going to rate your content as a ""2.""  peer 6      It is not an essay. There's no argument or analysis on it.      peer 1      I was impressed with your essay. If we were a class of creative writing I could give you a ""3"". I can imagine you in a class telling these, I am sure that all the students will follow you with a lot of attention, may be more than others's essays. But, without a face to face presentation, your text is very confused.  peer 2      Are you trying to fool me? or fool all the fellows students? you give me the pieces but there aren't a puzzle. I tried really hard to listen the sound of your biting heart, but there are not heart. there are no sound. sorry to be your butcher, and i wash my hands.  peer 5      I really enjoyed reading your piece. It's certainly a bold move. It shows that you not only analyzed Poe's big ideas, you also paid attention to specific phrasings, etc. This type of essay fits well with a literature class.  peer 6          score: 2+1;Thanks everyone for the inspiring words. And Javier I am no more concerned about the grades. I have a couple of 3s now, mostly because of not writing the traditional essay. But I am having a wonderful time with the course but I will be experimenting with the form and narration.  ;    Martha Ellen WaggonerYour essay...Is all made of quotations from wikipedia (which is not the best   source). Also, I'm studying science and even we don't need to remember so much about fixating.

Poems have tendency to foretell future sometimes. Maybe not, I'm not knowledgeable about Poe's life;I like your essay and enjoyed reading it. I particularly like the comparison you made with Icarus, and the references to ""Bladud, Jatayu and Kua Fu - who represent the Briton, Indian and Chinese ""version of Icarus."" If I had reviewed it,   I would have made a couple of suggestions regarding the form, specifically, just to tighten it up. For example, I think the second paragraph reiterates the first. I like the main idea you presented, but I think it would have worked better by omitting the Genesis reference and including it in your thesis. This would have left more room for analysis, as the third paragraph contained a little too much summary and not enough of your own original content with quotes from the text to support it.   I hope this helps, but overall, good job!;Aleksandar, your English is not bad. Basically, your sentence structure is fine, if a little awkward in places. Plus, there are a few instances where articles are either used when they aren't needed or are omitted, but these are minor mistakes. To save time, I'm only writing the corrections. For instance, It should read ""In ancient Greece."" Plus, by substituting a few words, this one would read better as ""This motif is ubiquitous in all cultures, which we can determine by examining the stories of Bladud, Jatayu and Kua Fu - who represent the Briton, Indian and Chinese versions of Icarus respectively.""   Also, this sentence is a little long, and could be simplified. ""Although their  stories of ""claiming the Sun"" are different for each character, the actual cause is the same (striving for perfection), as is the final outcome of death.  There are a couple of other places where the sentence structure is awkward like, ""When comparing the ""modern"" world with ancient cultures, we often time claim ""progress and prosperity"" in the name of  science and technology. (We sometimes believe) their advanced applications allow us to create a more developed society, one more evolved and better in all respects. From here, you could link the next paragraph with this one by starting, with, One such instance can be found in the short-story ""The Birthmark'""  As you can see, it's really a matter of cutting out unnecessary words, combining your thoughts into concise sentences when you can do so, and building your vocabulary. These things will all fall into place in time, so relax, you're doing fine.;I have gotten peer reviews like this, too.   It makes this course.... interesting, in a frustrating sort of way.;For the Wells essay,   I came up with an idea.   Then I wondered if anyone else ever thought these thoughts so I Googled some key words and discovered that someone had very similar ideas as mine.   In the reading of their article,   a few more refinements were added to my original idea.

Bethan, thank you for showing Banks' site - now I have plenty to read. I'm very sad about his death, 59 years is too short life for such person :(;Actually, intertextuality is a common practice if one studies Fairytales as a genre. Not only Rosetti and some other victorian writers practiced it, but also contemporary writers such as Angela Carter or A.S. Byatt.  ;That is such a useful reminder Joe -- I was thinking last night about lines from a poem by the German playwright Bertolt Brecht that carry associations of emerging from a dark and even monstrous primaeval place:I, Bertolt Brecht, came out of the black forests. My mother carried me into the cities while I lay Inside her body.  And the chill of the forests Will remain inside me until my dying day.Because as Sara Maitland notes when she explores the remnants of 12 British forests in Gossip from the Forest, these great dark   woodlands were home to   folklore characters like woodcutters, wolves, witches and   lost or feral children. I liked her retelling of fairytales too, the uncanny in a modern spin.The forest in many fairy tales is the   northern European forest of oak, pine and beech, filled with wild creatures and birds, hidden streams and   thickets, clearings with   old wells or   peasant cottages, the hiding place of robbers and bandits, a place   of secrets and   seasonal changes --   healing herbs and acorns or chestnuts for food, disorientating at night, hidden and dark, filled with shadows. It is also a place of transformation, with speaking animals, characters who are disguised or masked and not what they appear to be, roads that   lead   nowhere, paths that   offer danger and opportunity., untamed wilderness   A magical but threatening landscape -- and similar to mountains or lakes as places where   change takes place. or where worlds collide as an encounter between reality and   magic.;Good to find this thread -- I began working on a closer look at Rumpelstiltskin and   as I read more deeply and widely about the four older tales adapted and synthesised   into the   version published by the Grimm brothers, I   felt increasingly troubled by certain aspects. The miller's daughter agrees to give her   first-born   child to the   gnomish and cunning small man who   in return will   spin   straw into gold and save her life,   ensure her marriage to the king. She is in turn deceived and placed in impossible situations by her boasting father, her future husband and the   stranger who   appears to help her out.   Very typical of the   beautiful woman seen as helpless, unfortunate and depending on a rescuer of some kind. Why does this stranger want her child? A number of critics   commented on the widespread fear of   children or new-born infants being stolen, abducted, bought or lured away as having to do with Germanic   anti-Semitic   scare stories about Jews who would use the blood and   parts of the child's   body in obscene and devilish   rituals. Rumpelstiltskin was also often shown as a 'despicable dwarf' and prejudice against the disabled was widespread.When I was young I read and   enjoyed all these stories in a naive way and this course offers the opportunity to deconstruct   that naivety.   I'm glad of the critical awareness and shared discomfort   shown here   by other participants. Many of us   write and work in the   SF/F communities and   there is   still far too much   stereotyping in   fiction and uncritical appreciation of   writers like Burroughs, Lovecraft and others with attitudes that   need to be recognised as deeply offensive.;Ursula Le Guin's work is groundbreaking and   marvellously imaginative. In fact I don't think   I have ver found a particular emphasis on sex. Her slipperiness around gender was a unheard of at the time, long before Judith Butler. When I turned the page of a Le Guin novel and   read 'the king was pregnant' it felt as if I was entering another universe of possibility.;When I first read Bruno Bettelheim   s Uses of Enchantment, the   idea that the darkness and cruelty found in many fairytales and legends was in some way cathartic influenced my memories of   stories that had enthralled and   terrified me. Bettelheim suggested that fairy tale themes of abandonment, torture, violent death, witches, and grotesque   injuries gave children the opportunity to deal with deep-seated fears in a symbolic way. I   m no longer so sure about that and Betteheim   has been discredited in many ways as a theorist. At the same time, I   dislike reading    sanitised    or   tamed-down versions of   the fairytales I   heard and read as a child. The power of fairy tales is both   sinister and humorous,   dark and   hopeful by turns.  Reading through the   Household Stories this last week, I found myself wondering about traces   in them to do with histories of suppressed trauma. The     recurring preoccupations with food and shelter   may date back to times of famine or pestilence, the   mention of   soldiers or weapons to do with   European   feudal wars, the journeys undertaken may have to do with refugees   in flight or   homelessness after villages had been burned down or cities occupied by   foreign armies. The   vulnerability of orphaned children and young women is a persisting theme. Although the original   trauma may not be mentioned directly, I sometimes felt that some kind of tragedy, economic catastrophe or rape had triggered the   'story behind the story'.Freud   argued that    violent experiences are not registered consciously because  the subject does not have the psychic resources to process them,    which is why trauma is displaced, erased and   often only   found in traces or symbolic gestures that point back to what might have happened. The history of   northern Europe is a bloody and   unstable record from medieval times   through the   Renaissance and into the unification   struggles of the 19th century.    I   d like to hear if others have   wondered about this?  ;The issue of what children 'should' or 'shouldn't' read is a separate issue altogether. For most cultures you'd need a pedagogy that deconstructed   Hollywood appropriations before foisting Disney on children!Jen, I worked on Georg B _chner's   play Woyzeck (1837) a while back and that had a 'marchen' or 'fairy tale' that was   frightening and   eerie, a glimpse into the   underbelly of German militarism and working-class poverty, the anxiety of rapid social change across Europe at that time. But it's probably fair to say that throughout world history children from poorer families haven't been protected from the realities of   struggle, violence, danger.   A friend of mine in a   disadvantaged community school in South Africa   was telling us how the smaller children pretend to be boy soldiers in the Congo who   kill adults and   hide in the forest.   This might be the genesis for   a fairy tale or myth, a story that begins with play-acting to defuse fears.;Thanks for this link -- this is what I was hoping to find by enrolling in a MOOC for the first time this year.;I first encountered this   Victorian/Edwardian prurient fascination with small girls when I read the diaries of the Revd Francis Kilvert, a 19th-century vicar who   kept a diary while working on the Welsh Borders. The descriptions of landscape and   seasons were beautiful -- that nature writing the Victorians did so well. Kilvert was a young bachelor who married a   woman his own age and then died of peritonitis after his honeymoon.His interest in   little grils was creepy and fetishistic. He would beg them for kisses,   fondle them , spy on them   wait out for them and   stalk them ( in modern terms). His diariy entries refer frequently to 'caresses, loving looks, lap-sitting, and romps' with pre-pubescent girls. I doubt he   ever sexually molested them ( he may have been saving himself for marriage and   might have had a Christian respect for their virginity) but his infatuation with them was intensely amorous. and intrusive. His 'gaze' is always objectifying and possessive. He wanted to sketch them as   Lewis Carroll sought to   photograph them or   recreate them in literature. Kilvert was not ashamed of his passion for little girls but   exercised caution around   their hawk-eyed mothers. He preferred the company of children to that of adults.Very much like what we know of   Charles Dodgson. Like Dodgson, Kilvert found sexual innocence or purity to be erotic in itself. The Victorian idealisation of   young children centred on their   uncorrupt and   innocent beauty, their sweet obedient compliance with adult demands. The pedagogy of the   era was punitive and   conformist.   Few   parents or teachers had   any idea of a   child's right to any kind of autonomy or privacy. Children were whipped, starved, locked in rooms until they repented and 'behaved' themselves, sent away to boarding schools, threatened with   disinheritance if they did not satisfy their parents'   ambitions for them.   At the same time,   adults could relive their childhood feelings and   naughtiness   through play with children, a way of returning to   childhood Eden. Showing   physical affection to children was   more acceptable   than   touching, hugging or kissing   adult family members or   a woman to whom one was not formally engaged. Victorian society was an extremely repressed middle-class milieu with a thriving underworld of   brothels, adultery,   kept mistresses and pornographic fantasy. Other   Victorian public figures who showed the same   infatuated amatory interest in children included   Baden-Powell (his   encounters with his boy scouts make for quesy reading), JM Barrie, John Ruskin.How acceptable was this behaviour? I suspect many of their contemporaries   thought it immature, peculiar but not criminal.;I have read through and   evaluated three   essays on the first assignment and   all of them were more than 1 000 words in length, far in excess of the   word count given.Because this   is the first assignment, I am not penalising those who over-write but please   let's keep to the word count!It is inconsiderate to send in lengthy essays to evaluators who have five assignments to   read and   limited time. More importantly, it is unfair to those students who   made the effort to edit and cut their work down to   320 words or fewer. Those of us who work in media know it is much easier to write 2 000 words on a topic than 500 words or 200 words! Harder decision have to be made and   details have to be excluded.By writing   assignments of between 270 and 320 words,   we are learning to be concise and succinct in argument.;I checked the word counts each time by pasting them onto an MS Word program. You know, I don't want to discourage people who worked hard at   the first assignment and   this course is   done mostly for personal enrichment. So I didn't downgrade those who had exceeded the   word count. I also   didn't mark down those   struggling with written English.   In my home country we have many   students for whom English is their   second or third language, so we are able to   guide them skilfully following adult literacy principles. I   would like my evaluations to encourage those Coursera   participants for whom English is not their first language to   keep expressing themselves while pointing out some   of the more serious mistakes so they   can   learn from the essay feedback.The   evaluations are far more time-consuming   than I expected and   to read lengthy essays, correct   and explain language errors, and then comment on   the level of critical analysis will take several hours   each week. There should be a realistic   guide to this time-commitment   for those beginning   the course. Participants who have not already read the   books   to be studied are looking at a heavy workload with all the evaluating to be done.;"

The essays I marked exceeded 1 000 words in length -- I checked this and   those who received comments from me would have noted my comments on length.;Hi Patricia -- someone   PM'd me from the Facebook site and   the problem was my Samsung Android. There was extra text but generated by my own program. Very weird.   Thanks for responding, I'm' still baffled and glad I didn't mark anyone down. My comments will be off-beam but that would hopefully be offset by other evaluators.;Greg, I worked with the Sumerian myth of the descent of Inanna for a slipstream fantasy novella I did in 2010 (I publish under pseudonyms for genre reasons). I find that layering mythic aspects into a   story resonates even when the symbolism isn't explicit. And often the associations come up quite naturally, echoes of   something we   read as a child or dreamed about. Our imaginations are mythopoeic.Have you read Angela Carter's fiction? She   has reinvented many   older fairytale elements and pushed imagery of the circus to   bawdy burlesque --   Jeanette Winterson does something similar in her fiction too. Then there's Jane Smiley's A Thousand Acres -- I was well into the novel before I realised she was rewriting Shakespeare's King Lear and it   sent chills up my spine.   I am also thinking here of Iain Sinclair's psychogeography of   the London underworld.;Greg,   I see you write for a YA market, so consciousness of reader reception would be   uppermost. My notions of reader expectation or comprehension are   much vaguer! The   editor inhouse got my allusions and liked them, and that was good enough for me. I was writing about a character who goes on a potholing expedition in which an underground cave is discovered. There is a flash flood and someone drowns in the cave. A year later my character is recruited to lead a geological survey team to   the melted and exposed rocky territory undergoing development in the Antartic. She   realises she is being stalked by someone from the potholing group. Now the myth of Inanna has to do with Inanna being stripped down to psychic nothingness as she goes   down into the Underworld. Once there her sister   has her murdered and hung on a meat hook.   In my fiction, I used these elements of being stripped down -- losing torches, losing   contact, electronic   aids failing, losing a protective helmet, losing   the sense of direction and   even a sense of self. And in that increasing disorientation and darkness there is terrible violence that is also vengeance for a stupid   mistake that cost someone his life a year earlier. The imagery came to me   instinctively because I love the myth. Then I began weaving it into the fiction little by little. Some of it worked better than other aspects.[Sorry for such a long post -- I hadn't thought about that story in years!];I   signed up for this thread because of my interest in science fiction/fantasy and   so I have decided to look at the   symbolic Vorpal sword in Alice Through the Looking Glass for this week's assignment. There is so much   to explore in Lewis Carroll that I felt I could do an entire course on his work alone, but the Jabberwocky is a nonsense poem I   learned by heart years ago and   was intrigued by what a Vorpal sword might look like.  One, two! One, two! and through and through The vorpal blade went snicker-snack! He left it dead, and with its head He went galumphing back.   Are there any other sf/f lovers who have wondered about this iconic sword?;Sean this is not just bloody brilliant, but BRILLIG!Dodgson/Carroll said   himself he had no idea how he arrived at the   term 'vorpal' and the word play has been done by scholars who like acrostics or   word games. Not altogether convincing. The   Vorpal sword is more neopagan or medieval fantasy   than gospel. The   word 'Vorpal' is perfect for a 21st-century post-Star Trek, post -Bradbury-Asimov-Le Guin understanding.What does Tweedledee say? 'If it ain't Vorpal, it ain't dead.'Where does the Vorpal sword come from? The Mad Hatter tells Alice that it was stolen from the White Queen by the   Knave of Hearts, who comes across as an undiscriminating kleptomaniac who'll pinch anything of   sentimental or   real value. The White Queen safeguarded this massive unwieldy sword with its   notorious power of beheading.Where is the   sword now? Stashed away in the castle of the Red Queen who   has a fetish about beheading.What   does Alice have to do before she even begins to tackle the question of handling   the Vorpal sword? She has to   find the White Rabbit (that unpunctual mentor)   who will show her the way to a small building guarded by the Bandersnatch. Alice must retrieve the eye of the Bandersnatch, so she runs to find the dormouse who may still have the eye. (The eye here has an elusive quality not unlike the   smile of the   vanishing Cheshire cat.) Alice will have to cunningly steal the eye from Mollymkun and restore it to the Bandersnatch who will then   let Alice have the   Vorpal sword.The powers of the sword are limited. It has no mundane or useful uses, it would seem. Alice can't cut the bonds of the Mad Hatter and free him. She can only kill the Jabberwocky.The Jabberwocky as poem not monster has to be deciphered as a magical reverse text, the code to do with a   magical verbally concealed   Vorpal sword. Alice encounters chess piece characters. In an inverted world or back-to-front dreamscape, Alice   has to read the reflection   of the   baffling text as   mirror-writing. The Vorpal sword's origins may have to do with its ability to snicker-snack, relating to a large kniife known as a   snickersnee. The poem Jabberwocky comes out of language   that is carnival or burlesque and   singsong nonsense. The   poem Jabberwocky is an incantation, a way of   conjuring up a battle that will go on and on even though the Jabberwocky has been beheaded many times.Who is the Jabberwocky's true enemy?   ( This from Tim Burton's   imaginative film Alice in Wonderland.) the Jabberwocky confronts Alice in battle Alice, he quotes ""Ah, my  old foe. We meet on the battlefield once again."" When Alice states that  they have never met, the Jabberwocky says, ""Not you insignificant bearer. My  ancient enemy, the Vorpal One."";Well, so long as we footnote it, we can draw on popular culture too, Florence.   Creative approaches aren't discouraged.;Thanks for the link John -- love those nonsense words. 'O frabjous day' was a family saying at home.;Alice and game theory?;a Victorian clergyman in a waistcoat brandishing an unreliable   stopwatch. 'Bless my whiskers,' he cried out,' All this clamour for forum attention. Beware the Whitherstumpher's new crescendo...;I'm also wondering what this has to do with the course. Self-promotion   that has nothing to do with the purpose of the forum is   bad forum etiquette.;You're not alone Stephanie, I'm a bit 'vampired out', but I do recall being fascinated by parts of Stoker's novel before and hope to   feel that way as I read tonight and tomorrow.;Greg, you're right! Dracula is so modern. I'm blown away by the skill and   narrative power. It has pages that are trashy pulp (I quite like them) and all kinds of short cuts, but it is so clever in places.;"
FALSE,St101,Coh1,4,0,0,8,8.9089,0.897978,4,5,9,0.00777605,0.013745705,"Well, not as deliberate as that   Greg, but I understand the slipstream/speculative possibilities,   likely market and what   small publishers or   ezines are looking for. I don't   write much fiction -- most of my work is commissioned non-fiction, but I understand the genres I work with. I wouldn't say the myth made it easier but it did enrich my writing.There was something the   sci-fi writer   M John Harrison wrote   in   a Guardian review about the tension between the   Unconscious, irrational and creative material surging up and needing to be controlled by conscious intention that says a great deal to me about how some of us work. Images and metaphors appear and can be extended or deepened, so long they don't slow the pace or   distract from the narrative arc.;Hi William and thanks for the feedback. The key thing with writing fiction for me is that every element or   metaphor   needs a reason to be there and has to work hard to move the narrative forward. The symbolism should feel as if it belongs, occurs naturally. ;Good to hear from you Luisa -- so much to work with in African folklore, isn't there? I studied the griot traditions of West Africa (the novels of Chinua Achebe touch on these).;That sounds exciting Luisa -- you mentioned many of my favourite writers there.   I'll have a look at your website and leave   contact details.;Julieta, I was also fascinated by the different styles of communication -- diaries, letters, falsified letters, business letters,   cryptic notes, newspaper articles. And the speed and urgency astonished me for a Victorian   novel.Then there are the medical discourses and rituals of exorcism. So on the one hand there are those   largely undescribed blood transfusions (three hearty men giving their blood to Lucy) and   whacks of morphia prescribed. On the other hand there are   golden crucifixes, the sign of the cross being made, garlic garlands to repel vampires, a wooden stake through the heart and   beheading. Medicine works a little. Religious and   folkloric rituals work in extremis. And then there is the   treatment of   'madness' or 'lunacy', the   asylum and constraint. Oh and then the 'Just Married' lovers' discourse set in opposition to the irresistibly seductive and corrupt Count Dracula and his erotic vampirism. I can't get over how much   Stoker packed into   this novel and how   skilfully he brought such disparate elements together.;I hear you, Lauren. Most of   my post-grad work   dealt with Lacanian and   Kleinian (Object Relations) insights and   I'm used to post-Freudian studies, more to do with Judith Butler's Gender Trouble or   post-colonial deconstruction. A little   puzzled by the   uncritical approach to   textual analysis here.;  Really enjoying this thread. There are   layers of subtext here that intrigued me. Because the homoerotic content is unconscious and   possibly unintended by Stoker, it appears only indirectly and   for me it would seem to be coded as taboo or forbidden -- to   perform oral sex on a man or a woman would be forbidden, to drink or swallow ejaculate semen would be as   taboo as drinking blood, The 'little death', the swooning or fainting might be read as a trope for orgasm. There are the gothic undertones -- the religious extremism of   gesturing with crucifixes, the   quest for exorcism, the   superstitions of medieval   belief, the implied cannibalism of   consuming the   host as Body and Blood. The language of constraint -- women locked up in bedrooms, drugged unconscious, drained of vitality, the asylum, the   crazed craving for   torture, flirting with revulsion (rats and   flies), obsession with corpses, hints of necrophilia. If the reader wants to detect forbidden tropes or subtexts,   you need to read counter to the text, against the grain in many ways. If we look at the figure of Dracula, the   intense   relationship he has   with Jonathan Harker could be contrasted with the   hostile and   mercenary relationship he has   with the three female vampires. Jonathan belongs to him first and foremost, he will enjoy Jonathan before the   females can taste him. To counter   the corrupt Count, you find male bonding   between the men who are suitors for   the affections of   Mina. The men undergo another   kind of blood bonding via their transfusions under the tutelage of   Van Helsing. Lucy   is filled up with blood and revitalised   by each of three men in turn, they could all be her husband. Polymorphous and perverse! This is a   book that draws on Swinburne and anticipates the decadence of Wilde and Beardsley, or perhaps   Baudelaire and Rimbaud.   'The love that dare not speak its name' cloaked in   toying with bisexuality and   voyeuristic sadism shown towards the   sexual lust of   vampiric women. Nothing overt, but   we didn't have to wait until Anne Rice came along to find eroticism and taboo in   Dracula.;Yes, we're looking at pre-Freudian fiction here and   that is where the Unconscious has full play because although Stoker would have moved in a society brimming with hidden and   underground sexual modalities, none of this could be stated directly and he would not have set out to inscribe   what   would have shocked or repelled his readers. It is there though, the   lushness of description, the   play on gothic and perversity -- much more than   just homoerotic symbolism.;"
FALSE,St101,Coh1,5,0,0,14,16.3046,0.858651,12,0,12,0.025440313,0,"Greg, I think I posted elsewhere that I   found the different styles of communication media so skilfully done -- I could imagine a 21st-century character   texting as he walks down the   street, going into a restaurant and Google Glassing the place for celebs, using his   laptop on the   Tube to post on a manga or anime mailing list, popping into his bulemic recovery support group in the downtown clinic and   glancing through the clinic newsletter asking for blood donations, getting sexted by his ex and unsure how to respond, walking out into the street again and finding himself   in the middle of a   crowd of protesting activists sending one another Twitter updates -- you'd get the same speed and urgency, the same confessional or epistolary flow.;Efthymia, I found this very interesting -- the scandal of Oscar Wilde's arrest and details   emerging about his affair with   Lord Alfred Douglas caused consternation in   England and on the Continent. If anyone wants to read up further on this, I'd recommend Colm Toibin's The Master which is fictionalised but very close to what probably happened in Henry James' circle of friends, which had included Oscar Wilde and Andre Gide. James himself was seen as 'an eligible bachelor who showed no intention of marrying' and had several men friends who identified as 'inverts' or 'Uranians' until the Wilde scandal made it unsafe   for anyone to   associate with known homosexuals or show sympathy for Wilde. I imagine Stoker was forced deeper into that imprisoning closet along with many other men!One term or concept I find useful when   referring to the undercurrents found in   late Victorian literature is 'queer' because that carries connotations of not just   homosexuality but   the desire to experiment with forbidden identities and lifestyles. There's a new book out I've just ordered, Where Thy Dark Eye Glances: Queering Edgar Allen Poe edited by Steve Berman (Lethe Press, available from Amazon).;I agree about JG Ballard, not just Crash. I'd like to think that responses to essays would be open to   more revolutionary or subversive readings, but I'm not sure that is realistic.Under my study window I have a shelf of what I think of as subversive, transgressive or controversial fiction: Thomas Bernhard, Elfriede Jelinek, Michel Houllebecq, Robert A Heinlein, Georges Perec, Sylvia Molloy's En Breve Cartel, M John Harrison's Empty Space, Clarice Lispector,   the early Thomas Disch, Kathy Acker, Roberto Bolano's By Night in Chile. Just for starters!;Predictably Stranger in a Strange Land from Heinlein. Subversive is an odd word and many people have differing notions of what is disruptive or outrageous or transgressive.;Great stuff Sean, nothing like a feisty provocative essay to get the mind working! Lucy in Blooferland. Your reviewers lacked any sense of irony, which is always the risk with literature courses.Yes, yes, yes, I noted that damning reference to Ophelia (and remember that   Lucy's father was a sleepwalker, not a good omen), but what about the doppelganger or twinning of   Lucy and   Mina, the light and dark twins? Mina doesn't   flirt with three men and   accept transfusions from four, she instead asks herself:    What have I done to deserve such a fate, I who have tried to walk in meekness and righteousness all my days?    Lucy is Dionysian by night; Mina is chaste and   that   brings her respect from the   men around her, she   is able to think ahead because even when under the   hypnotic spell of Dracula's power, she   protects the men around her from any contamination, she   acknowledges her branding (Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter again).Once licentious Lucy the New Woman has died and   been ritually mutilated to ensure she loses   her Undead allure, the sexually reticent Mina comes into her own. Mina is Lucy with enough   prudence to avoid the   Fall. ;Right now I'm wrenching myself away from   Bram Stoker and   immersing myself   In Mary Shelley., but still fascinated by threads on   Carroll's Alice and Grimms' fairytales.   I can't wait to see what   the discussion threads will bring up next. Like many of us, I'm working extremely hard and having a great time. I don't know I'd have tackled this reading list on my own, and to read alongside so many smart and thought people is a huge plus.Yes, the peer reviewing is something of a lucky dip. My feeling is that   MOOCs are just getting off the ground and there is quite a steep learning curve underway. Not unlike   writing forums four or five years ago,   cluttered up with unskilful and unrealistic posters floundering, expecting overnight fame and   worrying about plagiarism.   Now there are a   number of published writers grateful for   the forums'   input of   agents, editors and   beta readers as well as stimulating conversations. A learning environment is the best place to make friends. And it would be such a pity to   complete a course like this without enjoying the process --;I'm participating -- I   write my weekly essays on themes or topics that fascinate or intrigue me and I hope will interest the reader,   then   sit lightly to the responses though I've had some   very perceptive comments.   I read carefully through essays written by others and spend   time giving feedback in evaluation. But the real engagement is with the books themselves and the discussion forums.;William, I agree, and   since you are an aspiring writer you'll find this   kind of   succinct writing exercise very helpful when it comes to sending synopses to publishers or writing 'pitches' for agents or just anticipating criticism of your written work.One   big issue with peer review is   learning to accept criticism from readers from many different backgrounds with   different expectations and   varying skills when it comes to reading. We all want an ideal reader, someone who 'gets' us the first time, someone   whom we think is 'qualified' to judge our work ( like a lecturer or professor). We want 'fairness', we want reasonableness, we want someone   just like us to read and   praise or encourage us. What we get is a mixed reaction that   pushes us to work out what is helpful and what   is not, how to disregard flattery and write more authentically, how to deal with rejection and keep working, keep taking risks and do the best we can because our own self-esteem as a writer or reader is not bound up with   acknowledgement from others. Invaluable stuff --;When I choose a topic, I focus on   a theme or   point of interest that   fascinates me and it is great to have the freedom to do so. But essay-writing is all about communication, so I try to make the theme or argument as lucid, contextual and interesting as possible for the reader.;Interesting post David -- although I do think Mary Shelley was not writing a romance but a novel in the gothic tradition and so the love interest was not as important to her. She was the daughter of a famous if impecunious   philosopher, William Godwin, and   her circle of friends and family   (including her   poet Husbnd percy and   Byron) had been discussing 'galvanism' which was a scientific or pseudo-scentific   notion of animating matter, drawing on old myths of Prometheus who fashioned   beings from clay   and the idea of the homunculus as well as the golem. We'd   call this kind of novel a 'novel of ideas' and that interests me in terms of scientific fiction because many science fiction novels are about the science of the future or ideas about society, about scientific discoveries that change society and the nature of relationships.;Yup, rather too much like life that way. We want a   scripted Hollywood   pace or   modern novel scenario, plotted for ease of reading -- and instead we   get   something that reminds us of life?Mary with tongue firmly in cheek.;Yes, a great quote and that   particular maturity of   Mary Shelley is   very much of her time. I've been working on an essay to do with the metaphor of   childbirth, the images of gestation, miscarriage, labour, stillbirth -- the many   conflicting and fertile aspects of creating a novel like Frankenstein -- and,   of course, this 18-year-old woman, unmothered and   who had grown up with an impecunious philosopher father had been through so much already. She was recovering from   childbirth and her baby daughter had died. She was   pregnant again and afraid she would not deliver a healthy normal   child, even as she wrote about   creating a monster. Her beloved half-sister Fanny had recently   killed herself and so had her husband Percy's ex-wife Harriet. All around her was uncertainty, grief and   new possibilities,   the excitement of creativity, the risks of leading such an unconventional   bohemian life in Geneva (she had run away with her poet at the age of 16 and her father had disowned her).And all of this dangerous knowledge and   the risks of travelling far from the security of her hometown would go into   her   novel.;I find this thread interesting -- would an artificial being   always be monstrous because he or she is not human? It isn't just being large, or out of proportion or threatening in   appearance,   it is   an unsightliness that marks the creature as Other., as not one of us and   unable to belong with us. The fear that he will mate and reproduce his own kind is why Frankenstein destroys the unfinished   female   creature. Humans cannot live with the inhuman.The paradox of course in that the   monster is one of the most   human creations in the book, he has pathos and yearnings and   his loneliness is akin to our own. Asimov's thinking desiring robots owe a great deal to Frankenstein's monster.;Thanks for this William -- fascinating perspective;"
TRUE,St101,Coh1,6,0,0,5,5.6508,0.88483,5,0,5,0.01511335,0,"I'm with you there, Joseph. 'Literary' can be much broader than just imagery or metaphors. That essay sounds fantastic.;And I'm very   pleased I did push you Sean -- onanistic creative surges indeed! Seriously, this makes for a thought-provoking read and I liked the way you put   the quotes in the referemces to give yourself more space for your argument.There's no guarantee here that any of us will   get   even three or even two peer reviewers who are on our wavelength, creative, adventurous, erudite, etc. These essays though offer an open-ended opportunity to push the envelope for ourselves, to stretch ourselves and test   hypotheses for our own satisfaction. The discussion forum threads are a much better guide to   topics and cutting-edge ideas than the format suggests. It isn't about learning to   dot the 'i's and cross the 't's for academic referencing. Nobody in their right minds is going to take a marking system   done in an   ad hoc fashion by unscreened and unsupervised peer reviewers to be on a par with accredited academic pass rates. These courses are for personal enrichment and that is the real potential. I'm looking forward to seeing what you do with the dipsomniac morbid genius Edgar Allen!;It is such a subtle and   enchanting story -- I would never have   read it if it weren't for this course. For my essay I looked at New England Puritanism in the Dark Romantic   fiction of Hawthorne and Poe, but there is so much more I would love to explore. In this story Hawthorne sounds very like the early   Henry James whose   work I love with a passion.;It makes me sheepish to admit this, but I came to sci-fi very late. When I was doing O-levels we   had a collection of science fiction stories and the English teacher   dismissed them as a novelty, not serious literature like DH Lawrence or Hemingway. I   remember most of the sci-fi plots to this day and there was a   Bradbury story there. I loved John Wyndham's Day of the Triffids and the Midwich Cuckoos but couldn't really   understand Asimov or Brian Aldiss. And then I was in my 30s and in bed with flu and   found myself given Ursula Le Guin, Joanna Russ, Kim Stanley Robinson and I   hated them. Felt   baffled and couldn't   work out what   and why these writers were doing this kind of thing.One night I was travelling on business and   unable to sleep in my hotel room so I watched a   klutzy BBC mockumentary on a city under a dome on Mars, walkways and artificial pools, theme parks, shopping malls, and my blood ran cold. I lay awake all night making up a story about a society of Mars dwellers trapped in a kind of condo paradise, no children being born, no way to tell the time (all clocks banned), days of shopping and   aimlessness. A custom-designed society in stasis that is suddenly invaded by   feral drug-crazed teenagers in stolen space ships.And   after that I was ready for the mind-bending fantasies of sci fi.;Inspiring thread, thanks Megan.When I'm   reading the   fiction texts, I jot down lines that strike me and my   reactions to certain themes or   characters. Then I   think about what   upset, or amused, or   moved me. A theme for an essay emerges and I take a   large blank sheet of note paper and   doodle around, images of tiny hands, coffins,   ineptly drawn roses. A design for a stop-watch. I look at what puzzled me, at what resonates,   list words and phrases that keep coming back to me. I sometimes do some extra reading, think about the lives of Hawthorne and Poe. Think about the   time and place in which they wrote.Then I go away for a day or a few hours and   come back and see what has coalesced, what is glowing for me. Has a new theme   been born on the page?   I draft out   a few paragraphs and   submit in case my   computer crashes and I   never get another chance to   submit. Later I come back and   look at what niggles me.   I rewrite and   restructure. I   look at   my last line, how to sum things up or leave things dangling.

Some of us try to fill it as fast as possible with every observation we've ever had about the text (me) and some of us throw down bullet points and then struggle to figure out how we can elaborate on what we just said. I know the pain of the latter problem, because I used to be that way, too.I don't know if this will be helpful for you or not, but I'm going to try something I've never done before vis-a-vis essay writing, inspired by Dr. Rabkin's examples - I'm going to take down my bulletpoints *as* I read, and then when I'm finished with the book, I'll have a list to cull and expand on. That way, I won't get stuck by being too literal (as often happened to me when I was struggling to fill the page), but I also won't be tempted to throw every possible theme and plot point at the wall in an orgy of self-satisfied personal discovery.At least, that's the theory. I'm not sure how well it will work, because I've never taken notes *as* I read before. I know that's probably heresy to many in this class, but the physical act of writing is difficult for me due to congenital disability, and my mother raised me to believe that the greatest crime in the world was to ""deface"" a book - so the combination of the two meant stopping to take notes threw me out of the story (and I love story!). This time around though, technology has made taking notes significantly less physically difficult, so I have a better chance of remembering to tap things out along the way.And in case anyone needs it, here's one of my favorite quotations from Aaron Sorkin, one of the greatest writers in film and television still alive today:     I love writing, but hate starting.

But I still break out in a cold sweat when I think about doing literary essays. I can write the heck out of any other kind - historical, sociological, scientific, whatever, but literary essays - ack. I remember angrily telling my mother that university was an upperclass game this working class kid didn't know how to play, because when I asked my professors what they expected, the answer was ""you're in college now, you need to figure that out yourself."" To which my mental reply was, ""I'm paying $20k a year and you won't even tell me the rules?!"" Like you, age and experience has taught me that the problem was *those particular professors* (who, I don't think it's a stretch to say, looked at what was then a 16 year old kid in a wheelchair who was only able to attend thanks to scholarships, decided I didn't belong there, and did their best to make me feel unwelcome) - not my scholastic ability. I now know that if I ever attend a school where the answer to ""can you please clarify the parameters of this assignment?"" is ""figure it out yourself,"" I am at the *wrong* school for me and need to get out of there! At 16, I just didn't have that kind of self-confidence.I, too, am loving the clear expectations here. I don't need or want to have my hand held, especially vis-a-vis writing of any kind... but I *do* need to know what kind of a goal I'm shooting for, and I think Prof. Rabkin has set that up beautifully.I'm reading once for pleasure and bullet points, a second time for more detailed notes with Dracula, The Left Hand of Darkness and Little Brother, because those are the ones I've never read before and I have the good fortune to be a very quick reader - the others are both shorter and not new to me, so I'm hoping to dive right in with more detailed notes from the start. I already devoured Little Brother in an hour last night (how have I not read any Cory Doctorow before now? He reminds me of Vonnegut, one of my favorite writers of all time), so I'm hoping my ""pleasure"" reads of the others will go similarly.My ""critical reading"" glasses are still a little dusty, but I think Prof. Rabkin has set us all up for success - that's becoming a familiar feeling with Coursera courses, something I never had at my brick and mortar uni!;As a writer, I can absolutely agree with the blank page fear that occurs when you try to start writing something new. Whether it is in electronic form or traditional pen and paper, the white page is an enemy to be slain. I have a tendency to over-write in my beginning process just to get rid of the vast openness of a new page. I will doodle or freewrite or outline, whatever I have to do to feel more secure and safe from the scary first step. It often times ends up looking like a disastrous mess, but it is something! I find that, especially when typing rather than handwriting, just typing as much as you can as an initial thought is very relieving. It is much easier in a word processor than on paper because you can toggle where you want to write next, be it in the middle or at the beginning or in place of something less worthy. Eventually you can shape your jumbled mess of thoughts into something far more gratifying.  ;Although I agree with many of the different views here, my primary concern is that I don't want to risk 'programming' my own way of thinking about a book. I think of it in terms of classical program music; if you are told what the music is supposed to represent, your experience is guided and it becomes more difficult to come up with your own ideas.

On that website there are several formats available, such as PDF, ePub and MOBI. ePub will work on almost all eBook readers. MOBI will work on a Kindle. There is also an HTML and plain text version, both of which can be read on a computer if you do not have an eBook reader.I had a similar question about the selected readings for this unit, but I believe the selected readings are actually all of the tales in this translation (not just some of them). If this is incorrect, please feel free to update my understanding.  Happy reading, and I look forward to more interaction here in the forum as well as in our peer reviews.;I'd argue that science fiction, like all literature, is evolving. Authors like China Mieville (who just happens to be on the tip of my brain at the moment....) are taking the concept of science fiction to interesting places. For me, science fiction's appeal lies in its ability to examine how people are/could be given the addition or removal of technology. The ""weird fiction"" catalogue fascinates me.... While some sci-fi holds over time, much doesn't. I've been pondering what gives ""staying power"" and what dates.... My current thought is that the author's ability to tell a story that reveals an aspect of humanity is what makes excellent science fiction... Regardless of where Real life science has taken us.... So awesome sci-fi continues to be born..... Just my two cents...... ;Since I'm only 14, my argument might have a lot of holes in it and can be easily crushed, but I agree with Matthew. If you take something like Star Wars, which can be technically be called science fiction, and an episode from the ninth,  tenth or  doctor in television series Doctor Who, one can clearly see the difference. While Star Wars has many elements that can't be directly explained by science, like the force and hyper speed, the tenth doctor explains werewolves as alien parasites, robotic men as being a type of vessel of immortality, and  zombies as being an accident concerning medical nanobots, which  are fantastical elements that can be explained with theoretical science. In conclusion, the genre of science fiction has indeed evolved to rely less on completely fantastical elements. Casey and Matthew,  feel free to correct me.;My favorite Sci-Fi author has always been Philip K. Dick, and largely that's because of the reasons he has for using technological explanations for things he can't actually do. He often describes technology that we actually have today, but didn't when he wrote of it originally. He was a paranoid schizophrenic at the very least, and had to be able to explain not just (Fantasy) that ""they are monitoring him,"" but rather (Sci-Fi) how they are monitoring him. If you remove the technology from his stories, they don't revert to being some sort of Fantasy story, but instead they fall apart completely - the Technology is a character, and needs to be built just like every other character.As far as the Pern books, those seem almost like they'd be right at home in both Sci-Fi and Fantasy. If you remove the technology, the stories don't fall apart but they are no longer the same stories. Pern without technology and science becomes something more similar to Xanth, where everything simply is.I feel like the major difference is similar in nature to the argument between Science and Religion (entirely over-simplified, anyway) with one explanation trying to say exactly how everything was done, and understand it; the other to look at it with awe and wonder. Sometimes, telling a story without explaining the impossible events pushes the story along, and I'd think of a story like that as being Fantasy.When it's all said and done, the two genres definitely have some overlapping room. I would imagine that's why this class seeks to study both.;I think exactly like you about that ""uncanny valley"" feeling because of the fast science and technological progress. What I think has happened to SF is that it has become more difficult to write when focusing on tech and ""action"" more than philosophy and character struggles. I find Neuromancer's ending every bit as appealing now than 10 or 20 years ago, the CODA is just filled with bitterness, but I think that TV and movies SF has been obeying to Hollywod standarsd (mostly) which ends up offering lame remakes of the same ideas.SF's real challenge is to begin dreaming again of the (for HIMYM fans) possimpable. I mean, SF dreamt so much time with many of the things that we have now, or see in the near future, that we need to, once again, propose the ""ridiculous"" stuff that will question our very own humanity as many authors have done (Gibson and Card are some contemporary examples of this done effectively IMHO).What do you think?;I lament that I can only read English, because it definitely hinders my ability to have a wide-range of source material to build my notions from ...;Karen, yes, I do! :) Pester away. Be warned that I know little about the actual coursera site, though - I'm more a hardware/software/OS/accessibility tech geek than a coding/website geek, so any queries about the platform itself are best directed to the appropriate board. While I'm here, the best free screenreader of anything you might pull up in a *browser* that I've found is Chromevox, located here: http://code.google.com/p/google-axs-chrome/It's a browser extension for the Chrome browser, so it's got a fairly small footprint and does a decent job. Unfortunately, it doesn't help with navigating your actual operating system, so anything *outside* of your browser (switching tabs, opening programs, using a word processing document etc) won't be voiced.Similarly, there is a Firefox plugin that has the same benefits (and caveats): http://firevox.clcworld.net/Macs have a program included in the Mac OS itself called VoiceOver, which is far and away the best screenreader that one can have outside of JAWS - it reads anything on the web as well as anything else you're doing on your computer.Windows has a free OS based screenreader too, but it must be downloaded separately, and which screenreading extension to download depends on which version of Windows you're running. Some of them are better than others. None are great.There are tons of screenreaders for Linux, but I don't use Linux, so I'd have to ask my buddy who does for his recommendations.Hope that helps anyone who might need such info.;I suggest you look into Audible for future reference.   It's an Amazon company that offers audio-books for a subscription.   I've downloaded the Android app, but I haven't actually used it yet.From what I saw this evening, I don't think it would be cost-effective for you for this class, as it limits subscribers to 1 book per month.   I looked up Frankenstein and one of the other novels for this class, one was $20 and the other $25 to purchase for immediate use.   I would not choose to drop ~$200 to read books for one free class.;Hi guys! Will we be using the course wiki? How does it work?Thanks;I think you have a great thesis.

But what you say obviously seems true and I think you should definitely write about the social status of men.;Thanks for the resource. I actually just wanted to share my thoughts. I'm only now working on the actual essay. But your input has been really helpful.  ;You were actually more helpful than you think. ;);I wanted to pick up on Karen's thought about ""luck"".   I had a professor who showed us the difference between the concept of ""fortune"" in Medieval times versus the concept of ""fortune"" in the Renaissance Era. These stories   are essentiallly Medieval folklore but were complied by the brotheres Grimm in the early ninteenth century. The medieval concept of ""fortune"" is a ""spinning wheel"" and mankind has little influence on their own fate. The Rennaissance concept of fortune, thanks to Machiavelli's The Prince, was that man could make his own fortune and could, to some extent, control his own destiny. I certainly see the medieval ""spinning wheel of fortune"" at work in most of the stories. Just a thought I wanted to add since Karen brought it up.;I agree with you, my mind was going in the same kind of direction.I haven't read all the stories yet, but I've noticed how the message seems to be in some of them: if you want to outstand a noble/king while you're of lower birth, you'll have to be smart.I can take the examples that stricked me so far:- ""The Rabbit's Bride"" - I feel that the Rabbit is the representation of the Lord who takes a part of what his farmers produce and can take a lower born girl if he wants. The girl sacrifize herself to save the garden, but gets away with a clever idea.- ""Six soldiers of fortune"" - The 6 soldiers punish the evil king by joining their very peculiar forces. Being written after the French and American Revolution, I wonder if there's a linked message of the power of the People over a king if he's not good enough???- ""Clever Grethel"" - obviously gets away from his master by a clever twist ;-);I tend to distinguish Science Fiction from Fantasy based on whether it deals more with technology, or more with magic.   So if you like role-playing games, I would classify Shadowrun as Fantasy due to the magical elements, even though it also includes a Cyberpunk / high-technology world.Of course, the quote ""Any sufficiently advanced technology is virtually indistinguishable from magic"" is relevant, and allows the issue to be confused.   I've seen convincing arguments that Star Wars is more fantasy than science fiction, both because of the Force and the strong Jungian archetypal themes.So I think that Utopian and Dystopian novels could be either SF or Fantasy.Are you familiar with S.M. Stirling's Emberverse?   It begins with more of a Science Fiction flavor, and in fact the Nantucket side of the story (""Island in the Sea of Time"" and sequels) continues with a historical fiction / science-fiction time travel flair.However, the United States / Washington State side (""Dies the Fire and sequels) of S.M. Stirling's story quickly becomes dystopian in the first few books.   I still think of the first set as Science Fiction, as it often deals with the technology of survival.   But by the second set of books, the story has become high fantasy, echoing old legends.Eric Flint's ""Ring of Fire"" series is another time-travel / historical fiction, that includes significant discussion of technology.   Even the act of displacing the town in time is explained as alien technology, not ""magic"".   Therefore, I would classify it as science fiction.   But I think I've digressed, since I don't think this series is particularly utopian yet (nor dystopian, but these stories lean hopeful, pointing toward an eventual utopian future).I would classify LeVar Burton's dystopian novel as science fiction, since it deals with technology and a near-future time.   But ""Elementals"", by Morgan Llewellyn, I'd call fantasy.Similarly, I would call ""The Handmaiden's Tale"" a dystopian SF, but ""The Fifth Sacred Thing"" by Starhawk is dystopian fantasy, even though Starhawk tries to build on the world of Handmaiden's Tale.;The boundaries in writing tend to be fairly fluid in my opinion, especially the further you get from fact and into the realms of the fantastical.   Genres are not so much boxes that contain and limit  as they are  puddles, reaching out and melting across attempts to  define borders.  Sci-fi/fantasy is particularly good at this because it's a built-in mechanism, anything is possible from imagining King Arthur  returning to save England in WW2, to  Joss Whedon's Buffy and Firefly series. One of my long-time favourites is Marion Zimmer Bradley's Darkover series in which an exploratory space ship is sent out from modern day  to colonise a distant planet, crashes and is subsequently ""lost"".   Fast forward a couple of centuries, and the colony is thriving, feudalistic and with a system of magic using matrices  which they describe as ""science"" ie ""matrix technology""  with ""technicians"" and ""monitors"".   When they are ""rediscovered"" by the more traditionally  technology-dependent Terrans of the original Earth, tensions ensue around multiple issues, including the consequences and ethics  of embracing certain advances.   For example, ""blasters"" are  banned by Darkover  as they  confer a greatly enhanced advantage to only one opponent; by using bladed articles only, each combatant must place him/herself in danger of injury or death, therefore meeting on equal ground.   With regards to medicine, yes, Terran practices can do wonderful things, such as improved  hygiene and the dispelling of harmful superstitions; but a midwife points out the downside  could include  a newborn with a heart defect who survives through such intervention will require greater care through life, and even pass on the defect to its offspring, requiring yet further intervention; widen that to the population as a whole, and the difficulties become swiftly apparent.   These questions also apply to the Darkovans.   Crucially, their  ""matrix technology"" is itself  linked to biology;  ""laran"" as it is called, is a genetic trait, with a physical presence in the  brain; and their society continues to  suffer from previous generations' attempts to  control and develop ever stronger talents through human breeding programmes which of went horribly wrong.      This series uses the genre of  fantasy  to explore issues around science and technology, ethics, feminism, social interactions, evolution,  languages etc.   Quite a lot is drawn from fact, from the ""real world"",  and what is deemed fantastical shifts depending upon perspective and belief systems.Right, that's my two cents!   :);Sounds like I will have to check out this ""Darkover"" series...thanks Christie!;Though the barrier between ""genre"" literature and mainstream literature is vague, it can never completely disappear. The best sci-fi and fantasy might be chosen by time and promote as the classic ones while the others are left behind and forgotten by the readers. There are some fantasy novels influencing the mass medias significantly now, but I don't think it means that these books are the first rank. The meaning of the distinction between ""genre"" books and mainstream literature is obvious, which is to pick the best ones and discard the mediocre ones no matter whether they are sci-fi and fantasy or not.  ;Wow. I didn't expect to get so many answers with so many good recommendations.  @Karren Abbott I've recently started reading The Hunger Games. I am on the last book, actually. I avoided them for a long time because YA books get popular and then you read them and they're awful. But I was very surprised by these books. Totally not what I was expecting. I thought the movie was really awful though. The thing I find interesting about them, maybe I'm alone here, but they're subdued. You know all these terrible things are going and you keep thinking ""Just defy the Capitol! GO!"" and you know they are but at the same time it's like you're slowly creeping around the corner to get that monster and it's just so calm about it. Maybe it's just me but I just got this subdued sense of urgency from the books.  I know it's not a book but has anyone seen THX 1138? It was a student film George Lucas did back in 1971. It's actually pretty good.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/THX_1138;Thank you for the essay. I know you haven't read it but they do get into the PTSD in the second book. A lot of the kids don't actually go and kill anyone. A lot hide and just get killed. Very few actively kill. They actually bring this up in the second book (I read the first part of the essay. I'll have to read the whole thing when I have time, so I don't know what all they're saying in the essay). SPOILERS AHEAD: In the 75th Hunger Games, it's called the Quell and they do something ""special"". Well, that year they draw from the pool of victors in each District. One of them remarks to Katniss that they all wouldn't be here if they didn't have a killer instinct. Basically that not that many people would/could actually kill when they're put into the situation. That we're not all like that. That's one point I have a problem with straight out that the essay says.  They actually mention a girl who won simply by hiding for the whole games. She never killed anyone. Also, at the beginning of the games, there's this place that they all start out in and they're in a circle around it and at the center is weapons, food, medicine etc. But the catch is, all the strong, well trained ones go for it. So, you can risk your life or head for the hills. Generally around 11-13 people die in the first few minutes. Only the strong or afraid survive.  Sorry, I really like these books and I think they make a lot of good discussion points, whether you agree or not.  ;It is true, Rebecca, that fairy tales have simple narrative structures, as do comic books, TV series and serial novels. These structures make them easy to follow   and probably made them easy to remember and enrich when they were part of the oral tradition.  But doesn't their main attraction lie in the wondrous and magical worlds they portray? ;I've been thinking this over for several days, and I'm not sure how clearly I can articulate this thought yet, so pardon any rambling.I do not enjoy Grimm, and I never have; not even the sanitized versions. However, I *do* get that comforting dopamine rush when reading (or hearing, or reciting) an *Irish* fairy tale - and I'm not sure why that is. I grew up on Grimm and Irish tales in equal measure, so it's not that one holds more nostalgia over the other. The Irish archetypes are not that different from Grimm; threes are prominent, so is nature, the same class issues abound, and on and on. But for some reason, when I *think* fairy tale, I think Cuchulainn, or Fionn MacCumhail and Benandonner, or the Salmon of Knowledge, or The Children of Lir... but if I pick them apart, they hold the same kind of morals and the same general take away messages as the Grimm tales do. I suppose on the most simplistic level, I find Irish fairy tales more interesting or more enjoyable... but I can't even deconstruct why *that* is.I am almost afraid to think about it too much, lest I get distracted from what we're *supposed* to be writing about... I'd much rather deconstruct the Irish ones!;Hitler came much later than the Grimms and German nationalism, so you might need to revisit that hypothesis.   Remember, 'Deutschland ueber alles' meant 'Germany as a whole comes before Schleswig-Holstein' before it meant 'Germany conquers the world'.;It may be partly about the memory of being read to. Read these tales aloud to someone else, and they take on an entirely different quality. There's something very dreamlike about them, some mapping onto the unconscious even when we're annoyed by the amoral or malicious character coming out on top, or a repetition of ridiculously rigid gender roles, or the apparent lack of logic.;I would offer another perspective. We love these stories, in a way that we don't (some could say can't) love other stories. If for no other reason than these were given us at developing periods prior to critical analysis, of both literature and our world in general. They speak to us because they have become archetypal and fundamental. On a quick aside, I once heard a literary anarchist (I forget the fellow's name) in Berkeley who spoke of the pagan roots of Disney's versions of the stories, he said that Disney was the most counter-cultural icon in the 20th century namely because he got 'Christians' to love old pagan tales...an argument could be made in many regards his assertion (for instance the initial artwork added Christian images), but I've always found the idea compelling (much in line with JK Rowling's, Potter series as well).;"
TRUE,St113,Coh1,2,0,0,52,56.0697,0.927417,15,0,15,0.010382868,0,"I had the opposite experience.As a kid, I would read the SF&F shelves in the children's section of the library (aka, the YA section).   As I approached adolescence and found I had read most of the books on the shelves, that's when I started drifting to the adult SF section.Unfortunately, one of my favorite YA SF writers was Robert Heinlein.   I quickly learned that his adult books were, well, adult.   I was a lot more cautious in the adult section after that, but I did go back.As we moved around, I made a point to check both sections.;Re: The Handmaid's Tale genre, you make a good point.I'm reminded of another distinction that I often use for SF and Fantasy:SF usually / often occurs in the future, when space travel goes between star systems, or on alien worlds.Fantasy often occurs either in the past, other universes, or on worlds where the technology level is approximately Earth-medieval, and the astronomy of star systems / constellations are not relevant.Of course it's not as clear as all of that.   Anne (& also Todd)   McCaffrey's PERN novels are a hybrid - Dragon's Dawn and similar first-pass stories I would call SF.   The Lessa & F'lar stories begin as Fantasy but with the discovery of AIVAS become more SF.   Most of the stories in between those two poles (Nerilka's Story, Dragonsong, Dragonsinger, much of Todd's co-authored books, Moreta, etc.) I would classify as more Fantasy, because they deal with dragons and a medieval-tech world.Honestly, I always considered Speculative Fiction to be a meta-category, one that includes SF, Fantasy, Horror, Historical Fiction, some Mystery novels, and probably other categories I haven't thought of.;I am in the same boat. I think I am seeing the end of the tunnel and then an avalanche of books happens. Not a bad thing though. Honestly, I had been against reading them since they came out. I read the first one on the recommendation of a trusted friend who also had the hangs up about PR and what not. I devoured the first book in a day and it brought up so many points, at least to me, that I just kept talking to people about it. There's definitely more to the story.  ;I would agree with Rebecca - your comment is very insightful! I don't think that when the Grimm Brothers were writing they were only focused on one particular point - morality or trickster (while I think your recognition of the fact that the tales are composed of many genres helpful!).   When I read the tales I get the overall sense of a fantastical commentary on humanity, the times in which they lived and the societal realities in which they inhabited. In reading the Six Soldiers, one of the main themes appears to be that in order to get justice from an unjust King - authority figure - the common and honourable man (the soldier committed his duties well according to the beginning of the story) must band together in order to successfully receive what was due him (the gold at the end which was split between the men can be seen as the well earned retirement of the leader).   Thus, that tale can be read as social commentary on the hierarchal realities of that time. While others - such as Aschenputel, extol virtues that were considered important and are more reminiscent of a morality tale, and still others like the Rabbit's Bride are more reminiscent of warnings, or recognition of dangers which existed for women and girls at that point in time.  ;Karen, yes, it's an interesting notion, to be sure. As you say, Germany struggled with (and I think in some respects still struggles with) the concept of national identity - funnily enough, if you speak to modern day Germans about this, a lot of them will tell you their national identity is at least partly board games. A quick diversion to explain why this is so, and why it's a legacy Germans rightly rally around - after WWII, Germany banned any games pertaining to war, for obvious reasons. While the US and other countries designed and refined games like Risk, German boardgame companies were forced to turn to non-combat topics, and quickly discovered that no one else was making *strategy* games. In addition to that, no one else was making games that could be enjoyed in equal measure by the whole family. (Monopoly is not a strategy game - the only strategy is ""buy everything you land on"" - and is not accessible to children who don't know how to read, for example.) Germany got *on* this problem, and created an entire *industry* of strategy games that can be played and enjoyed by anyone old enough not to eat the pieces, using the same rules for your 5 year old as your 95 year old grandmother. The games tend to be identifiable by having interesting choices to make on your turn, dynamic setup (so the board is different each time), little to no randomness, and themes ranging from farming to history to travel to building a coral reef. They're now called ""Eurogames"" or ""German games,"" because in Germany, boardgaming is a massively popular family activity. The largest boardgaming festival/release party is in Essen every year, and it's a worldwide, bring-your-family-and-play-games event. The biggest and most coveted award for a boardgame is to be named the Spiel de Jahres - Game of the Year in Germany. Even American-designed board games fight for that distinction, because if you land on the list, your game will sell out, in Germany and often across Europe (sometimes in America, too - that happened with Settlers of Catan, a German game, and Dominion, an American strategy card game, when they got the SdJ.) So, if you ask a German what it means to be German, many of them will say, ""we make excellent games!"" And they're right!As you point out, while the Germans struggled to find ""safe"" ways to celebrate being German, the Irish struggled to be recognized as Irish at all. I'm positive that influenced the development (or stagnant nature) of their tales. How much is historical and how much is cultural, I think it's probably impossible to tease out. (I realize that's the point you were making, so I'm not insinuating that you were making any kind of a declarative statement there.) I'm inclined to think that culture provided the natural momentum in either direction, which was then aided by history... but without being able to travel back in time to the late 1700s/early 1800s, I doubt we'll ever know. There's only so much scholarly research can answer that question, I think, due to the passage of time, the near-annihilation of the Irish language, collapsing and reforming governments, An Gorta M _r, etc. Ironically, the historical *upheaval* in both countries is probably the biggest factor in our inability to definitively answer the question we're pondering!;Re: WWII and its effect on the UK vs. Germany - wow, I'd never thought about it that way before, but I'd bet you're right! I think the effects of WWII are sorely underestimated by Americans due to the way we're taught about it in school. It's very much presented as ""Hitler did some bad stuff, but how were we to know what he was really up to, it wasn't really our problem, but then the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor and *then* the war started."" Typical arrogant Yank stuff, I know! But I was usually the only one with my hand up going ""Er... the Brits were getting the living daylights bombed out of them. Roosevelt made his big ""you don't haggle over the price of your garden hose"" speech regarding the Lend-Lease Act in 1940*, so are we to infer from this that it was in fact Congress being a bunch of feckless thugs during the year that elapsed between that speech and us actually getting involved (that is, business as usual for that branch of government), or was FDR receiving political pressure from an outside source?""That usually got me a ""see me after class.""   What can I say... I'm an American from the Irish diaspora, and the combination makes me disinclined to accept anything that smells like bull pucky. I am also probably still legend at my former uni for the only class in my life I ever walked out of, wherein a history professor announced a unit on ""The Famine,"" accepted my offer of a variety of source texts she had never seen (half and half, Irish and British, but all much better than the revisionist ""The Irish were too stupid to eat or grow anything but potatoes"" crap in most American texts), and then, months later and having thanked me profusely for lending her said texts and allowing her to mark them up, promptly began the unit with ""The Irish were too stupid to eat or grow anything but potatoes. Here, let's laugh at political cartoons depicting them as flea-ridden monkeys!""Me: ""Er... are we going to discuss political satire in the 1840s and 50s and talk about where it came from and what the effects were on the various immigrant groups and persons of color it satirized? Possibly even tying that into the immigration debates of today?""""No, I just think they're funny."" (In fairness, those weren't her exact words, but it was certainly the gist!)I can't even remember exactly what I said, but it was lengthy and remarkably clean considering how much red I was seeing.Anyway, yes, I'm sure you're right about WWII being a huge causative factor in the sharp cultural division regarding the virtues of redemptive violence and the depiction of it in play. Makes perfect sense to me. And it makes me want to dig through all the modern retellings of fairy tales I know and see if I can spot the more recent evolutions!For myself, I'd rather have a copy of Agricola than a model Spitfire, but then, no one can fault the British for their heroism in WWII, so I can see the appeal of model Spitfires, too. :)* You probably know this quotation well - most non-Americans I know have a far more comprehensive knowledge of WWII than Americans do - but for anyone interested, the full ""you don't haggle over the price of your garden hose"" Roosevelt quote I would refer to in these discussions, which concerned to what degree and in what form the US should help Britain during the war, goes like this: ""Suppose my neighbor's home catches fire, and I have a length of garden hose four or five hundred feet away. If he can take my garden hose and connect it up with his hydrant, I may help him to put out his fire. Now, what do I do? I don't say to him before that operation, ""Neighbor, my garden hose cost me $15; you have to pay me $15 for it."" What is the transaction that goes on? I don't want $15--I just want my garden hose back after the fire is over."" - Franklin D. Roosevelt, Press Conference, December 17, 1940 (in the middle of the London Blitz, and almost a year before the attack on Pearl Harbor).;The glossing over of WWII was (and is) a systemic failure of the US public (free, government run) school system - not till I was taking uni-level US History in my last year before uni did I have a teacher who was *allowed* to contradict the texts. Most public school textbooks are printed by one of three companies in Texas, and they all spout the same inaccuracies, which the teacher is not allowed to contradict unless a student raises the point first. (Then it's ""class discussion,"" otherwise it's ""against the AKS,"" a manual that dictates what students will learn each year, and thus what teachers must teach, and how they're allowed to teach it) Fortunately I had a mother who was a history buff and a little bit of private school under my belt, so I was usually the one going ""Sir, wait a minute, what about...?"" Private schools tend to use a much broader range of source texts, so there's a little less indoctrination going on - apart from ""Bible based"" private schools, which is where all the creationism madness and the like comes from.The ""Irish people are flearidden monkeys"" thing was an incident at a fairly prestigious private university in the Southeastern US in 1998, and the kicker - the professor in question was ""proudly Irish"" (by which she meant Irish-American) and kept going on about how much she and I had in common (I'm also Irish-American of course, but I still have relations and friends there, and was raised more in the ex-pat community than any other, so *my* idea of what it means to be Irish-American and *her* idea of what it meant to be Irish-American were two very different animals! Don't get me started on the horrors of St. Patrick's Day in this heathen country...).But yes, it's all true.Re: ""What people believe about the past is more important than what did happen"" - sadly, I've heard people say similar things here, including some teachers... it drives all the good teachers I've had crazy. I think it's a bastardization of the old ""the victors write the history books"" chestnut, but *I* was always told that by family and good teachers as a *warning*, i.e. don't just read the victor's side.""Changing people's beliefs by using facts and evidence is a tough sell."" - oh yes. I live in Georgia, I know *all* about that! :);Karen, sorry, I think I was the one who wasn't clear - the ""what people believe"" quotation is absolutely true, the problem comes in when that's the end of the discussion (as it often is in my area)! I didn't mean to imply that the fellow who made that observation was anything less than a good teacher. :) In conversations about identity, I often joke that I am a person without a country. Born in Michigan, moved to in Georgia at age 7 (talk about culture shock), but in both cases, raised amongst ex-pats from the Republic, the North, England and Scotland. (Not so much Wales, for some reason. Not sure why that is.) My childhood was very much filled with observations, stories, ideas, and conversations that wouldn't be at all out of place in any pub (including the football!) It even colored very American things; our Thanksgivings are spent explaining the concept to the ex-pats who've never been through an American Thanksgiving, and answering the incredulous questions that result. (""Wait... so you lot have a huge over the top meal to commemorate annihilating the natives?"") I've seen both Gerry Adams and David Trimble speak. Larry Kirwan is a family friend and was one of the first people to help me get to grips with Irish. Our pantry was always full of goods you can't get here.... marmite, branston pickle, Barry's tea, hobnobs. (My American friends thought our house was some sort of magical wonderland - ""what is salad cream, and why are you reading a newspaper in another language?"") As to my schooling, the first year was spent at a segregated school for disabled students, which was its own culture. The next few years were spent at a private school my father called ""tree-hugging hippie school"" - it was one of the first schools to use what later came to be called Montessori. We had little deskwork and lots of discussion about current events and important historical figures (Ghandi, Dr. King, Mandela, world leaders, etc. Alan Trammel (baseball player) was our ""Person of the Week"" one week, but only because the Detroit Tigers had done really well for a change!)Schools then desegregated for disabled students, and we combined our move to Georgia with my entrance into public school. That was when I realized that everything I knew was either ""wrong"" (by the metrics of American schools) or at least, ""different."" All of a sudden I was going to school with students who had no knowledge of other cultures and teachers who didn't know what to do with me on any level - I'd been doing work at a 16 year old level at my private school, so I was terribly bored being plunked back in with 8 year olds, but I needed supports the public school system wasn't used to providing (I can't physically write by hand), and I was constantly trying to delve into topics at the depth I'd experienced at private school, which made me few friends and many enemies. I spent the next four years trying to learn how to ""be American,"" when all that time I'd thought I was already!I entered high school at 12 (instead of the more normal 14-15) and finally found a rhythm and a sense of belonging in my small town southern school, which had fantastic teachers who saw something in me and pushed me harder than I'd ever been pushed in my life. (My mother still likes to relate the tale wherein I came home from school crying because I had a C in English for the interim grading period - a C! I thought the world was going to end. Mom asked if she needed to call the teacher. My reply: ""No... Two of us got a C, the rest of us failed."" At that point, mom was *definitely* going to call the teacher. Me: ""No... she said this is a gifted level class and we're not doing gifted level work."" Mom: ""Is that true?"" Me: ""I guess so... but this is *hard*!"" Mom called the teacher... to thank her. :) ) It scares the hell out of me that if I'd been born about 5 years earlier and had had different parents, I might not be able to type this sentence. Segregated schools in the 70s and 80s US were more like ""holding pens"" or ""respite care"" for disabled pupils - very little learning went on (that wasn't the fault of the teachers, but rather the system, which dumped all of the disabled pupils of a similar age into the same classroom, regardless of their abilities or limitations). Anyway, it all results in me having little idea how to answer the identity question. ""Irish-American"" works in casual conversation, but the term is so diluted these days that it doesn't really convey how proud I am of my heritage, and how immersed I've been in its culture. At the same time, I have no right to claim more than that (and I would never dare!). ""Disabled"" is certainly a culture, and one I ""speak"" fluently (I can carry on a conversation in ASL, ""see"" for a blind person, help someone navigate obtaining a service dog, advise someone on how to figure out a way for them to do laundry or cook a meal, and repair pretty much any wheelchair on the market, as well as playing several wheelchair sports most of my life), but the non-disabled world doesn't recognize it as such - to them, disability is a terrible thing that we should work to erradicate. ""American"" is certainly true too - despite myself, I do love this country in many ways, particularly the optimism of its political system as written. The founding fathers, the Kennedys, and FDR are nothing short of heroes to me. On the other hand, many aspects of this country drive me crazy, and the connotations of ""American"" to the rest of the world (and certain subsets of Americans) are not something with which I like being associated. Despite living in the South for 24 years, ""Southern"" definitely doesn't apply. ""Midwestern"" fits much better (and most Americans peg me as such right away) - but then I have to explain how and why I haven't lived there since I was very young, and that I only visit once a year. ""German-American"" certainly fits - my father's side of the family has a decidedly Teutonic bearing, and I've had people pick that out in me too - but then I have to explain why I speak Irish, not German, and why everything else about me is so distinctly *Irish* (to the point where Irish-born people have asked me what county I'm from and told me my American accent is *brilliant*!) I envy the Americans I know who can proudly say with no equivocation that they're American, full stop. I have always felt like an outsider looking in to this country, but I've never known exactly where I'm looking in from.;Not to mention Li'l Stan Lee:;Pre-Freud, pre-secularism, pre-mass media... I like to think they'd be intrigued, though some of our ideas would be just plain baffling, rooted as they are in almost 200 years of cultural difference! But I reckon they'd be up for it. They wanted to preserve the Tales as they heard them, but they were devoted to the project of understanding them. I reckon the Grimms would be pleased as punch that we're still puzzling over it all :);I'm confused because I can't find space for the title. Unless the title's counted as part of the word count?  ;Thinking of The Company of Wolves turned my thoughts on to Tanith Lee's fantasies.  Red as Blood, or Tales from the Sisters Grimmer  had that genuinely weird, archaic feel to them that she also used in  Tales From The Flat Earth.  Her White As Snow  felt old, old, old with its Kore-Demeter themes and its terrifyingly warped trees and folk magic.My Grandma wouldn't have told tales like the Grimm tales - they'd have been a bit too demented for her. The sanitised versions are what she told us. The scarier, darker versions are what kids tend to seek out for themselves.;Urban fantasy often deals very much with fairy tales: Characters from the Grimm collection, from mythology from all over the world, magical and religious traditions pop up in modern settings.Charles de Lint's written lots of urban fantasy novels set in a fictional town, Newtown, near a Native reservation in Canada. Some of the inhabitants find their ways to the Otherworld through odd, liminal places (a tree in a park, abandoned buildings, etc.), encountering their ancestral spirits and the gods, spirits and magic their forebears brought with them to Canada from Europe. And the Native spirits are a constant presence, communicating with those tribal members who uphold traditional views and practices. When I read Gaiman's American Gods, which I adore, I did wonder if he'd been reading de Lint.There's a whole chunk of fantasy literature in this vein, in which modern people are forced to accept the reality of fairies and other supernatural beings, having to visit the fairies' home territory (often described as bewildering, dangerous and frightening) as well as having to repair or mitigate the effects the Otherworld is having on ours.  Raymond E Feist's Faerie Tale is set almost entirely within a fairy mound as a father searches for his abducted child. Laurell K Hamilton has written a whole series about a fairy princess desperate to escape the ongoing war between the Seelie and Unseelie courts. It's becoming very popular to examine fairy traditions this way, especially by female authors.;My intro to his books was Onion Girl, and my husband's was Trader. The books all tend to work as stand-alones, though as you read more of them you can see how they interlock. It makes them accessible while also ensuring that each acts as background to others.;Well, the NSA is scooping up all your online activity, so probably.;You want my real name? YOU CAN'T HANDLE MY REAL NAME!!I don't know what came over me...;You know nothing, Jon Snow!;Have you seen that massive list of key words and phrases they use to flag up potential trouble? It's so enormous it must surely render itself useless.  ;It's been years since I read a version of Baba Yaga, but doesn't the dawn, noon, and night explanation feature there? I seem to recall that Baba Yaga asks Vaselisa (?) to answer the riddle of the white, red and black horsemen.;Good old Robert Graves - where would 20th century Neopaganism have been without him? :);I don't remember not reading. I could certainly read before I got to school. Reading was just something everyone in the family did. We had practically no cash, but there were enough cousins and neighbours to keep books flowing like the melange in Dune.  As a kid, I'd read anything. Books, comics, the labels on tins at the shop...  ;We seem to have a lot in common :)Comics had to come out of pocket money or be passed along from someone else, so they were more occasional treats than anything else. Dad had read The Eagle when he was a kid, and The Beano and The Dandy were classic parts of a working class British childhood. Though I think they'd both have been horrified if they'd realised that 2000AD  and Misty contained such... ""mature themes"". I think they saw comics as normal, benign kid-lit, so I got away with it without being checked.It was the books that worried them. Having been absolutely petrified by Poe at 7 years old, I was under strict instructions about not reading books that were too grown-up and scary, and they did linger around while I was scouring the library, and had an understanding with the librarians that anything ""too much"" for me would be gently discouraged.  ;Oh, good grief, Megan - I think our Dads were clones.Kathleen - it IS a good question. My sister loves reading, but she never read as avidly or omnivorously as me. She was way better at art than me, and was very much a visual learner. I've slowed down because ME (CFS) causes varying degrees of ""brain fog"" that can make reading harder. I suppose that, like Megan, growing up in a family where word games are the norm, from competitive punning to Scrabble to Boggle, helps. As a late primary school child, I was very much bullied, and I was always what my Mum called ""a self-sufficient, solitary soul"". Given the choice between playing out and reading, reading usually won out. Socialising is really important to me, but my ideal adulthood was very much on the lines of spending my life reading... well, everything. Maybe being a bookworm's innate.  ;It is the weirdest thing, isn't it, how literature classes at school tend to suck the life and pleasure right out of reading. I was already addicted enough to reading to find pleasure despite it.  How brilliant that you bucked the trend and became a reader as an adult!  ;There's something about the Harry Potter books, apparently! I read the first one, and never got round to the rest, though I enjoyed it tremendously. An old acquaintance has a daughter with serious learning difficulties who found reading incredibly frustrating. But when she was 11 years old, her parents gave the first Harry Potter book. They realised she'd gone very quiet, and went and stood for ages at her bedroom door just watching the pleasure on her face as she read. It transformed her experience of reading forever.It sounds like your kids are doing really well. An A* is tough to get when you're working in your own language! Congratulations :);Oh, wow. Samantha was looking for audio books in this thread - we should definitely put a link there.;And some very cool art based on it:  http://www.themarysue.com/amelia-pond-alice-in-wonderland/;It is cringe-making and emotionally tiring. Mind you, it's all around us still. If you've seen the Everyday Sexism project, for instance, or checked out feminist geek culture sites like Feminist Frequency  or The Mary Sue, Nine Worlds, or  Finding Ada, there's brilliant light shed on the ways in which women, queer and trans people, people with disabilities, and people of colour are treated in SF&F art and culture.  I am nowhere near as aware of issues around disabilities and colour as I need to be. Yet. There is a cultural shift going on, with Den Of Geek, for example reporting on this year's Cripping The Con.I read a lot of vintage and Victorian literature, and it's fascinating to see how attitudes have shifted. It's also uncomfortable to see how much in play those attitudes still are in wider culture today, though damped down. We've learned that being overtly bigoted is socially unacceptable. The problem is that we've tended to assume that it's only the overt displays that are problematic. It is hard to find the more subtle underlying assumptions in ourselves and others and deal with it.And you're right. There's a point at which dealing with in-your-face bigotry makes you want to throw things. Saeed's made a great point: we can de-fang it by dealing with it as a group. Mutual support makes all the difference.;There's a good essay about how being a member of multiple minority groups really throws the unexamined assumptions of the dominant group in your face here - a bi-racial (White and Native American), queer, trans, poly, working class geek on comic cons. The comments are also interesting.;This is really interesting. Thank you :)In early 19th century England, spinning, brewing, baking and dancing were masculine pursuits as well as feminine. I'm from an old textiles town, and spinning and weaving were pretty much evenly spread across families and age groups in this area before the industrial revolution; when the machines came, spinning became almost entirely the province of women and children. Brewing was a woman's work up until the late middle-ages when the ale laws came in, pushing women out of owning alehouses and brewing for them. Baking was a communal activity here outside of big houses, with communal ovens dotted about, usually run by men. And dancing was an important social skill for everyone.Was it the same in Germany?I love how many areas for exploration you've opened up in one tale!The tradition of Lilith having known God's name is something I didn't know at all. That is fascinating.;Frustrating, isn't it, that there were so many socially engaged and well-respected women involved in all areas of intellectual endeavour, and yet they're airbrushed from history.;There is a tendency to assume that criticising a book/graphic novel/film/tv series/game for this sort of thing means you can't enjoy it, or that if you enjoy it you can't criticise it. As Anita Sarkeesian put it, it's vital to enjoy and criticise in order to make what you love even better.;I think it's true that you can portray a fully inclusive and nonviolent society in an exciting way. Conflict isn't necessarily about violence. Conflict will always occur because people vary so much. We tend to think of peace and inclusivity as a passive, static state when they're really processes, ways of being in the world that foster creativity and adventure. There may be more innovation than in an egalitarian world in which nonviolence and co-operation mean that education and the confidence to experiment are the norm.  But the physical fight is ingrained as short-hand for ""standing up for yourself"" in our world. Want to show how a woman is empowered? Give her a gun and make her ""kick-ass"" (generally while she's wearing high heels and something skin-tight). Want to show a slave asserting their own power? Have them kill their master. Want to demonstrate a revolution? Make it violent.It's so ingrained that it takes a lot more creativity and hard work to come up a nonviolent reaction to violence, and to even imagine that a story that doesn't include violence can be thrilling, absorbing or meaningfully deal with some form of conflict. Some of the best SF&F manages it by doing it on a small scale (Bradbury does this repeatedly), and though there's something of an Anglophone fascination with Quakers (for some reason, we pop up quite a bit in sci-fi), there's a tendency to go down the easy, well-trodden route of the hero as The Just Warrior, whose violence is done in the name of good, and is therefore morally justifiable, so we can all just chuck our qualms out of the window and stop worrying about it.I have a tremendous love for blockbuster sci-fi films and tv series (how excited am I about the new Agents of SHIELD series?? And the love of Wolverine is almost lifelong), and yet I'd still like to see them do better in the creative approaches to solving terrible problems stakes.  ;Nathan - I didn't articulate that well. I wasn't saying you meant that conflict necessarily must mean violence (physical or otherwise); I was saying that this is how it's played out in most areas of fiction today, and that sci-fi and fantasy are often guilty of dealing with controversy and conflict through violence.  Of course we need to read things that are controversial, and deal with issues that make us uncomfortable, things that potentially disrupt our prejudices. We need to be stretched. Seeing structural violence as well as physical violence embedded in stories as the natural order, or what is morally right, time after time after time, though, can be wearing. And that's a problem for fantasy (in which so often the solution is a bunch of fairly privileged folk fighting for the return of The Rightful King to rule over his happily top-down hierarchy) and sci-fi (in which so often the solution is for the hero to take up violence/learn to temper his violence with mercy so as to be a Just Warrior).;Yes.So often, the people pushing for this are not the people who have suffered because of those attitudes, and aren't actually comfy enough with the people who have to ask their opinions and shed some prejudices. I do wonder how many of those adults who object are just trying to dodge hard questions from their kids.  ;In my experience, there's plenty of ground between ""It doesn't bother me"" and ""It bothers me so I want to censor it"". It's not an either/or proposition. The ground between those reactions is the fertile area for discussion and growth.;I wish I could upvote this a gazillion times.Yes.

In my opinion, the story centers around the maiden. The rabbit is an intruder, someone who comes to the garden, takes what he wants and rudely asks for more - he wants the maiden to ""sit on his tail"" and go with him. That is a hint of sexuality. In the 18th century, sex was strictly considered a matter of marriage. Therefore, when the maiden is seduced, she automatically must be married to the rabbit, who turns out to be not a very good husband at all. BTW, which maiden would ever wish to marry a rabbit instead of a man? In silly words, the very rabbitness of the maiden's seducer  is meant to symbolize an undesirable trait in  a husband.  That is how the poor maiden was punished for disobeying her mother's advice. I have to say I disagree with the opinion that there was a problem of communication between mother and her daughter. 18th century mothers (or grandmas) who told this story would not wish to give such a message to their children.

I even read that Cinderella is originally a Chinese fairy tale, which I don't know if it is true... but who knows? And this is not just Cinderella. Lots of the same fairy tales are commonly told in different parts of the world, perhaps with  subtle nuances.  I think they may have developed independently because people went through pretty similar situations in their everyday life. Whether the  fairy tale  was meant to be a warning story with didactic purpose or a story that personified ideals and values they believed in (therefore it was pleasant to listen to), some similar motives  may have develop independently and later influenced each other. And as a result, we know the same or very similar fairy tales all over the world.;"

Thirteen years, five or six drafts, and probably 500,000 to a million pages later, I'm just now getting to something workable, novel-wise.Needless to say, I love to read and write, and I'm looking forward to learning a lot in this course.;Go blue indeed!

After 24 years, fellow Midwesterners who live here still randomly say, ""Hey, you're from Michigan!"" but when I go up north, I can hear that slight southern edge to my vowels. Then, of course, there's the fact that asking for ""pop"" got me ""what?!"" down here, so I switched to calling everything Coke (orange coke, pepsi coke, etc)... so now when I go back to MI, people look at me funny and say ""We don't have Coke, you want pop?"" D'oh!I pick up accents *very* easily and unintentionally (I tend to code-switch without thinking about it), so I *should* have a full on southern accent after all these years, but as a kid, I was upset at leaving ""my lake"" (Lake Mich) and thus determined to never sound southern... but nowadays it makes me feel a little like a person without a country, lol!I keep thinking about moving back to go to college at U of M - or maybe Grand Valley State, where I spend my summers at wheelchair sports camp (first as a camper, now as a counselor/mentor) and where I have more family - but I think the weather might kill me.

Over the years, I've discovered that for me bullet pointing makes everything alright. It's much easier for me to jot things down, connect the dots, and merge points when the ideas are separated out that way. It also took being out of education for many years to gain the confidence to just ask what is expected and how best to meet that expectation (or run like the clappers from it).  It's marvellous to have really clearly stated expectations AND a slew of resources to help us meet them. The video clips and the student essay portfolios on the wiki are immensely helpful and reassuring.  I've never taken notes *as* I read before. ... stopping to take notes threw me out of the story (and I love story!). This time around though, technology has made taking notes significantly less physically difficult, so I have a better chance of remembering to tap things out along the way.I  understand how stop-start reading breaks the flow. I find it impossible to read anything first time round while taking notes. My plan is to read once for pleasure, make some bullet points about overall impressions, then read again while taking notes.;Oh, I hear you on class and academia! Though the late 60s and 70s saw a lot of university fees paid for by the state in the UK, and so a lot more working class academics were in place by the late 80s, there was still a real skew towards the culture of the public school when I was there. I just continuously assumed I was wrong or stupid or just incompetent, whereas now I know that there was a systemic failure to transition kids from ordinary state schools to universities. Some of my lecturers were really great, and one gave extra-curricular classes on writing for his course, but the overwhelming majority were, I think, blissfully unaware that any of us needed any support.I reckon a bunch of people I was at uni with got their degrees despite the obstacles, not because they got help. I dropped out due to chronic illness, but ended up hanging out with a bunch of academics later in life more by accident than anything.

By Katrina's definition above, and by the one given by Prof. Rabkin, as you point out, *all* fiction is fantasy - at least, all *good* fiction should ""invite suspension of reality."" Even if a novel is a ""slice of life"" work, by its very nature, it is a fictional world, and not actual events that happened in anyone's reality - otherwise it would be a biography.As someone who writes ""slice of life,"" I've been asking myself your question since seeing the first set of videos. Is, then, what *I* write fantasy?Yes and no.Yes, in the sense that it is all a fictional (and hopefully immersive) world. One that closely resembles our own, but in which the protagonists deal with Big Things perhaps more often than average. Sometimes those things are good, sometimes they are bad. Sometimes the characters win, and sometimes not. The biggest way in which my ""universe"" differs from the real one is that the protagonists are rather better communicators than Joe Average. They are not preternaturally so in any way; rather, being good communicators is a survival skill and a cultural talent they value, so it's something they've worked to cultivate. But that's the most fantastic thing about them. Well, that and the fact that they're meant to be dead.No no, don't misunderstand, they're human. A hundred percent human. They just should be dead by *now*. No, it's not Tuck Everlasting. They're just regular people, leading regular lives... but they both have a disease which should have killed them long ago, and it hasn't. No, it's not a supernatural or special disease. It exists in this world. And they're not particularly strong, or healthy, for that matter - just lucky. Like many thousands of people who wake up every day and go about their daily lives when statistics say they should be dead. Some of the plot is about how they cope with that - most of it isn't.I have explained my ""universe"" in this way for a reason - if I did my ""job,"" did you notice how quickly you were willing to accept that there might be something fantastical going on? And yet, they are very average people with, for the most part, average lives. But part of a writer's job is to capture your attention and your imagination at the same time. To say, ""Come with me....and trust me."" If you can't get the reader to come along, your work is for naught. But once they've come along, they have to trust that you're going to lay out some rules, any rules, and abide by them.   The rules can be as mundane or ridiculous as the author likes, but they have to stay consistent within the narrative. Now that I've told you why my characters aren't dead, and emphatically explained that there is no supernatural cause, it would be cheap for me to say, ""but actually, they're secretly vampires."" I'd be breaking the rules I set out, and thus breaking the ""contract"" between myself and the reader(s). At the same time, hopefully the reader has that little niggle in the back of their mind - why are *these* people alive? Why those specific people? Is there possibly a reason that even the protagonists haven't uncovered? Or is the universe just that fickle? That is one of the spaces in which I play. I like that sandbox.So that's how all fiction *can* be fantasy - done well, it primes you to accept anything. (What would be the point of reading Sherlock if, in the back of your mind, you didn't wonder if *this time* he might miss something? You trust that in the end, he'll solve the mystery - he's Sherlock Holmes! But maybe, just maybe...)Here then is why what I write *isn't* fantasy - there's nothing otherworldly in it. By the common definition, fantasy must contain at least one *impossible* (not just unlikely) element. Harry Potter has magic. C.S. Lewis has Narnia. Naomi Novik has talking dragons fighting historical battles in the Air Force. My protagonists aren't impossible, since, as I said, they have a real disease with real consequences that real people in this world have survived for extraordinary periods, too. Not impossible, just unlikely.By the latter measure, Sherlock Holmes and other such characters (Poirot, etc) are fantasy because they belong more to the world of archetype than reality. As much as you think they *might* fail (and that's important, because without it, there is no dramatic tension), you trust that they *won't* fail. It would break the rules (and shatter your trust) to read a Great Detective story where the detective bumbles around, stomps on the evidence, blows the case, and at no point saves the day.... all because he hasn't had his coffee.That's why the latter metric is more useful to me; and probably more practical to use in the everyday world. But I do like the idea that all good fiction is fantasy in its own way, simply because a good writer can (and might) take you anywhere.;Thank you all for taking the time to respond. Megan, your illustration was the light I needed, thank you. I feel more comfortable going forward now. I will enjoy relating the stories in the reading list to this new thought about the 'limits' of fantasy. I will have to look out for your stories as well. I write only fact and read only fiction :)   ;Interesting point Megan. I had read, among the many things said about 50 shades, that it began life as vampire fiction.  When it comes to using genre as a selling point it is tricky subject. When people look for books they start with genre, how will your book be found? Even factual books can be difficult to categorize. Unfortunately difficult to categorize books don't sell well.  ;Megan,That is good advice for peer reviewers. I never said, though, that I wanted the process to change, and I already gave an example of another class that does not have to go to this extreme. I am not telling the professor how to run his class, as everyone seems to think. I simply stated that I was confused and if the grading is a specific way, I would not fully participate. That is my choice. I understand everything that's been said, but this goes against what I stand for as a student and as a teacher. I am still excited to learn from the professor and the peers, just not through the writing assignments.  ;My concern would have been that you dropped out without giving it a fair chance, Katrina.   Don't leave before we get to play with you!   ;Megan - I 100% agree with you in re: Irish folk tales. I would argue that they are more complete. Characters are complex, have struggles to overcome (or fail to overcome....). The story arcs are complete. There is a sense of realistic consequences to actions....;Anahita, it's an interesting topic you've started. It's a question I've been asking to myself for a long time, as fairy-tales are the only literature from my childhood that I can read again and again and it doesn't matter if I know the plot already or not. I think one of the reasons is their simplicity. You don't have to make your brain sweat to understand what's written there and then, as they lack lots of details, there is room for your own imagination and it's definitely pleasant to build up all these castles, forests, wicked witches and princesses in your mind.;Theres a lot of fantasy and Sci fi to enjoy, The Power Rangers were one of my favorites and Lightspeed and TimeForce are still good if you are into them.Animated Fantasy and Sci Fi besides anime that are good today:Adventure Time just some boschian random sh*t happening all the timeBen 10 it is a great concept well executed in the first seasonTeen Titans (not the new one) and Young Justice if you like DC comicsAvengers Earth Mightiest Heroes if you like Marvelsome years ago some french cartoons boomed and quality tv rised with good shows like Totally Spies and Code LyokoAnime:Shiki contemporary rural town gets vampedAnything Gundam, specially 00 or the originalCode GeassGuilty CrownIRL Sci fi and fantasy are sort of harder to get but Stargate and Game of Thrones are still airing, and of course Battlestar Galactica reason enough to own a netflix account and watch and rewatch it till time ends.;"

And in the inter-war period as the Irish Republic was forming, and then after WW2, as Germany really struggled with concepts of national identity without falling into nationalism and veered the hell away from folk traditions, the experiences of the Irish in the Republic and Northern Ireland were totally different.  It'd be foolish to imagine that it's the explanation, which isn't what I suggested; but there's something in there, I reckon :)Megan - The storytellers in my Irish family do the same :) Sadly, there was an estrangement between the English and Irish sides - the Irish side being local bigwigs did not approve of marrying into a long line of peasants - so we're only now getting to know each other. And even family stories seem to shift all over the place!Again, is that a difference in culture between German and Irish people that pre-dates the folk revivals, or is it that the Irish were not politically constrained in how they approached the stories? In fact, has the use of folklore in the Irish struggle against British rule actively encouraged a fluid telling to make it appropriate to the moment in time?Like I say, I'm not proposing that I have the answer, just possibly part of an answer.;I had no idea about the board games. Non-violent gaming - actually, non-violent anything in terms of entertainment - is hard to come by, what with the ""myth of redemptive violence"" being so pervasive. WW2 was probably a just as huge a reinforcement of that idea in the UK as it was an incentive to move towards non-violent entertainment in Germany.That was really, really interesting stuff. Thanks :);Oh. My. Word.  This was someone actually paid to teach? And your textbooks actually said that stuff?  My gast has been officially flabbered.Mind you, as a teacher once told me, ""What people BELIEVE about the past is more important than what DID happen."" And an anthropologist friend told me that, ""Changing people's beliefs by using facts and evidence is a tough sell.""  ;To be clear, the ""what people believe"" thing was about recognising the gap between facts and evidence on the one hand and the mythologising of history on the other, and how the emotional resonance of a mythologised past actually go on to create our cultural and political reactions in the future. He was a grand teacher :)I lived in NJ for a good few years, and Other Half's of Irish descent, so I remember the culture shock of St Paddy's. A bit different than the version we get in Manchester, which is itself rather different than in various bits of Ireland... I did have several occasions when Irish-Americans gave me grief about being English, before we established that my Irish ancestry was more recent than theirs. But being Irish or Italian or Greek or any other hyphenated American is obviously going to be quite different than it is in ""the old country"". My attitude was, at first, pretty dismissive. I arrogantly assumed people were claiming an identity they'd no right to. Surely they were Americans, and that was that? I hadn't realised then that identities are complicated things. It took a few humiliating experiences to discover that a lot of my assumptions didn't hold water.That said,  I've never got over the idea of green beer, and I don't think I ever will. Some things are bred in the bone!Your mention of the textbooks reminds me of James Loewen's Lies My Teacher Told Me, which really made me question what unfacts MY teachers had passed on to me.;I enjoy the new shows as much as the old ones.   I especially think the newer ""villains"" are much better.   The Weeping Angels are great and the Silence are pretty good.   One note on the old shows is that the BBC destroyed their copies of many early episodes in the 60's and 70's.   As a result some episodes survive only in audio form.   What a shame!;And for those interested, the results of that project are now available online here: http://www.loc.gov/collection/federal-writers-project/about-this-collection/;Yes, the assignment page will count the words and tell you how many you have. In addition to that, the submit button won't be clickable if you go too far over the limit! The thesis is counted in your word limit. (Your thesis also does not have to be the first sentence in your essay, just somewhere in the first paragraph. A good thesis should be recognizable as a thesis no matter where it is.) The references in your works cited are not counted in your word limit - citations go in a separate box that usually doesn't have a word limit at all.Contractions are frowned on in academic papers, but since Coursera is peer graded, nothing is ""not allowed"" on its platform. It is up to our peers to grade appropriately, and I doubt anyone would remove points for contractions. (I have never had anyone in my other Coursera classes remove points for contractions, anyway.)Word counts are a common metric in American academia, especially after the advent of the typewriter/computer. It is a way to ensure that students do not abuse the guidelines for, say, a five page assignment, by putting too many spaces between their paragraphs!;Katarzyna, yes, that's right. You *could* put ""Thesis: Text"" at the top, if you really wanted to, but generally a thesis statement is a concise statement *within* the early part of your essay that tells the reader exactly what you'll be exploring, such as, ""In Grimm's tales, the dangers of jealousy are represented by stepmothers."" If the rest of your essay is about the various ways the tales use stepmothers to warn against jealousy, that would be a good thesis statement, and the reader would be able to pick that out as your thesis, without you having to put ""Thesis: In Grimm's tales, the dangers of jealousy are represented by stepmothers,"" at the top.In fact, a good way to check if your thesis is strong enough is to write your essay and then read it back to yourself and see if all the other statements relate back to your thesis. If they do, then any other reader will be able to figure out your thesis, too.Happy to help. :);Anonymous, the Coursera word counter has frustrated me many a time, and I still haven't quite worked out exactly what counts as one word or two by its metrics! I think you may be right about apostrophes causing words to be counted as two regardless of whether they're used in a contraction or the possessive. It seems like there are one or two other oddities about it, but I haven't figured them out yet.Hyphenated words definitely count as two words. Citations within the text - e.g. (Grimm) or [1] - sometimes count as words, sometimes not. (In previous classes, I could sometimes eke out room for another word by deleting the space between the phrase and the citation... and sometimes that didn't work.) All I can say is, I am eternally grateful for that buffer (usually between 30-100 words) between the ""official"" essay limit and the point where the submission button greys out. I'd never get anything submitted, otherwise!;Anonymous, I am irritated by any word count limit under 2000! I have figured out, though, that the main reason Coursera professors tend to set low limits is because it is our peers who are doing the grading, and they are each expected to evaluate multiple essays. If everyone in the class writes as extensively as I would like to, that is a lot of reading for a peer to do, especially if their written English skills are not good due to a language barrier or a learning disability, or they have difficulty with their sight. (We have students with each of those challenges in this class with us at the moment.)   A student who is mentally or physically fatigued by reading in their non-native language, or by reading print of any kind, will fail to read *carefully* after a little while, and that would unfairly affect the grades of those of us who would like to go on at greater length.Even though I hate it, I am warming to the challenge of trying to express my ideas in such few words. As Prof. Rabkin says, it is helping me crystallize my thoughts.;Emily, I'm just a fellow student, but I thought Prof. Rabkin covered things pretty well in his ""How to Write for this Course"" lecture. If you haven't seen that yet, go check it out, it may help you get to grips with his intentions direct from the horse's mouth.This course, to me, does not appear to be markedly different from even the most basic literature course. Don't let the ""level"" spook you; I would venture to guess you probably *have* done this before, even if you've never written an essay on it - most of us interpret literature without thinking about it. (Dr. Rabkin says this in the videos, too.) Consider ""The Tortoise and the Hare."" It's not just about a literal rabbit and a literal tortoise, is it? The merits of perseverance, the perils of laziness/cockiness, the importance of not counting one's chickens before they hatch, the dangers of being a braggart, the importance of hard work and practice, pride goeth before a fall... all of those themes are potentially in that story. And all of them would make a decent essay. You can probably think of more.Unlike scientific writing, there is no absolute structure involved in a literature essay, because there are no (or at least, few) absolute facts, since literature can be interpreted in many different ways. Prof. Rabkin covered this in the videos, so you can check my breakdown against his instructions if you like, but this is the general summary of how a literature essay works.Pick an idea that says something about the text on a deeper level than what the literal story is. This can be a general theme you've noticed, or it can be found by paying attention to specific words to uncover a ""hidden"" theme, as Prof. Rabkin demonstrates.Develop this idea into a sentence or two that encompasses what you would like to talk about. (Example: ""Stepmothers are evil."" becomes ""The evil stepmother symbolizes the importance of the family unit and the fear of outside influences destabilizing family harmony."")This sentence becomes your thesis. Check through the story(-ies) you are analyzing and make sure that your thesis is supportable. (Example: ""Stepmothers are evil because remarriage is a bad idea"" would be a bad thesis. It says nothing about the deeper meaning of the story, and you can't support that thesis with the story text.)If your thesis checks out, write your essay around it. Write sentences that support that thesis statement and examine it in greater detail. When you're finished, read over your essay and make sure that every other sentence in it relates back to your thesis (the thesis itself does not have to be labeled ""thesis"" and can be anywhere near the beginning of your essay. If you have supported your thesis well enough and made sure every statement relates back to it, the reader should be able to spot it without explicit directions).That is as close to a ""formula"" or a ""structure"" as any instructions for a literature essay are ever going to come, I'm afraid. I'm much better at scientific papers than lit papers myself, so I understand your desire for greater structure and clearer instructions, but the reason there aren't any more than what Prof. Rabkin has already given us is because literature is about personal interpretation, and personal interpretation varies as much as people do.;I too am struggling with this - I have one ""outside connection"" in my essay as it stands right now. I will probably leave it in, as it has to do with the time period in which the stories were told, which I think is necessary to make my particular argument complete. I think it's easier to avoid any outside connections with a longer work.... for example, when I wrote a paper on mythology in Fahrenheit 451, there were enough various mythology references for me to deal with in the text itself so as to make expository information about mythology unnecessary. With Grimm, because the stories are so short, one's choice of thesis might easily require a tiny bit of outside contextual reference.I could, of course, just choose a different thesis, and I still might.... but I really like the one I've got.;""Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they aren't after you..."" ;I think about that every time I run a search for something dodgy. Makes me wish there was something standardized that writers could put on our computers along the lines of ""it's just for a novel, I promise!"";Karen, I've seen it, and given what the NSA is doing on US soil these days (though not, it must be said, solely to Americans!) we should all *hope* it's useless!Elise, thanks for my first laugh of the morning! But yes, something *exactly* like that. :);These are all great interpretations! I think there is also something to be said for this story being a ""do not defy the natural order of things"" type of story. Cats and mice are considered to be ""mortal enemies,"" and the cat could not overcome his true nature as a predator. This would have been an important lesson to teach children in the time period in which these stories were told, when the class system was strong and behaving or associating ""above one's station"" was frowned on.It is a theme to some extent echoed in Orwell's Animal Farm - the animals seek to build a utopian society they never could have had with the humans around, only to find themselves echoing the very worst aspects of human nature. In the end, the animals are worse off than where they began. Of course, Orwell was sending a much more complex and ultimately different message than is in the Grimm story - but the message of ""disrupting the natural order of things can have unpleasant consequences"" is the same.;I'm sure it's fine from an academic integrity standpoint (as others have mentioned, previous students in the course have already done so). I would personally be wary of posting a complete draft of an essay on a publicly accessible website *before* the peer review deadline for that essay, though - even if it's just a draft. Not because it violates any academic integrity standards, but because, sad to say, in a course this large, there will always be a few unsavory or desperate individuals who are tempted to plagiarize. The number of individuals tempted to do this tends to drop as the course progresses (because those people drop out).But for myself, I would hate to post a draft of my essay and then have a peer reviewer see two (or more!) copies of that essay and mark me down for potential plagiarism. Since peer reviews are done anonymously on both sides, the reviewer has no way of knowing that the person who wrote one *particular* essay is the same one who posted it online in the first place. This happened in one of my previous courses - a student copied an essay she had authored herself and previously posted online, others found the same essay and copied it too, and the whole lot of them ended up with zeros for plagiarism, because we had no way of proving who the original author was.So, were it me, I would stick to blogging general impressions/reviews of the book and your essay topic, but avoid quoting from that essay or posting any drafts of it until *after* the peer review period. Unless doing so would completely break your blog format, this could even become an ""eagerly awaited"" feature of your blog - as soon as grading closes, your readers get to see the final product!;Remember, though, that The Six Soldiers of Fortune begins with the line, ""There was once a man who was a Jack-of-all-trades; he had served in the war, and had been brave and bold, but at the end of it he was sent about his business, with three farthings and his discharge."" In other words, the soldier is seeking revenge for having been wronged - not looting and pillaging for no particular purpose. In that sense, the Six Soldiers of Fortune might be showing not the *reverse* of Faithful John, but the same general moral - if you serve faithfully, you are entitled to reward.;Oh, absolutely, there are plenty of morally questionable things in the Six Soldiers. For that matter, cutting off the heads of one's children (as in Faithful John) is pretty morally questionable! One of the things I'm coming to appreciate about Grimm's tales is that the more you look at them, the more meanings and interpretations float to the surface.;I was raised in the oral story tradition, where one of the greatest compliments one can get is to be asked to tell a certain rendition again, but repeating a story is considered not possible, because the story varies depending on the audience, the mood, and the very night it is told. As you point out, you can tell the same *general* story, but never the same *exact* story.At the same time though, writing is, I think, beginning to share certain things with the oral tradition that have only been possible since the advent of the internet. It's true that once a story is written, it's less mutable than an oral tale. Consider, though, published books vs. the massive online community devoted to fanfiction about those books. Fanfiction has, in a way, existed for as long as the written word (the temptation to tell a familiar story in one's own way is, I think, universal), but only now can the people who want to ""play"" in an author's world find each other, tell their own stories, find their own stories shaped by others who are playing (sometimes in real time), and so on.Similarly, I've been working on a novel for over a decade now, and I had far too much material to wade through and a difficult time sorting the wheat from the chaff. So I went to a fellow writer and friend of mine, and said, ""I need to play with these characters a bit. You've read some drafts and you know what I do - can you knock together a character and we'll throw them together and just see what happens?""So we did, bouncing dialogue and scenes off each other over various instant messaging programs. Sometimes line by line, sometimes a page or two at a time. I've sorted out my characters now, but my friend and I still play this way a few times a week, just for fun - and although we do copy everything over to a document at the end of the night, and we build on what's come before, the *feel* of what we do is far closer to oral storytelling than writing. Writing is solitary - storytelling is interactive. Writing is considered - storytelling is immediate, improvised, adjusted on the fly. Neither can be replaced by the other; what my friend and I do together, fun as it is, isn't really publishable. We do it for the experience of it all (just like with storytelling). What I do on my own is harder, but it's a better *read*. And I never would have had the experience of written, interactive storytelling without the internet. So, I think the lines between oral storytelling and written stories are beginning to blur.... and for me, that's a fantastic, delightful ride. ;Leonardo, indeed! No matter how much preparation you do as the Dungeon Master, the players will always push you in directions you didn't anticipate, and usually discover entirely new, unplanned stories by doing so.;As someone else who is unemployed and time rich but cash poor, I second the library suggestion. I bought the two books in question used off amazon, but only because this happens to be the only time of year that I have a little bit of money in my ""used books"" fund! If the library is not possible due to lack of transportation (lack of bus fare/gas money/etc), I will simply say this: The internet has everything under the sun, if you look hard enough.(Edited to add: As a writer myself, I hope everyone in this class finds legal means of accessing the material - piracy devalues my own personal craft, and I don't endorse it. As a person of severely limited financial means, though, I know that's not always realistically possible, and since this thread is about accessing the material for *study*, it puts things in a slightly different light. Crystal, I hope you do have the means to get to the library or a nice cozy book shop. If, though, getting transportation to a place like that is a pipe dream because you're struggling just to keep the lights on.... the internet is a vast place.);The syllabus, located here: https://class.coursera.org/fantasysf-003/wiki/view?page=CourseSyllabussays, ""the specific stories are the ones in the Lucy Crane translation (1886)  which was published by Dover and is available online through Project  Gutenberg.""In other words, if you are using the Lucy Crane translation, you are supposed to read all of those stories. Hope that helps.;When my mother found out she was pregnant with me, the first thing she did was buy dozens of children's books, so I was being read to all the way back in utero. :) When I was two, my mother ended up on total bedrest during her pregnancy with my sister. I could just barely crawl by this time (I have cerebral palsy), so mom was trying to deal with a curious, but nearly immobile, two year old while dad was at work. She figured she might as well teach me to read. I remember loving the process of learning, but hating the circumstances... it was a hot, sweaty Michigan summer with no air conditioning and few fans, with the temperature often exceeding 90F/32C during the day. I wanted to go to Lake Michigan (a 15 minute drive from our home) and cool off, not practice my phonics! I persevered and was reading fluently when my sister was born, just in time for my third birthday.I haven't stopped since. Thanks, Mom.;Karen, first of all, I promise I'm not stalking you! :)But as one who'd also read anything, your last comment reminded me of when I was about six and went through a period of wanting to read a lot of comic books. Not solely comics, mind you. And not ""standard"" comics. I had happened upon comic book adaptations of O. Henry, Dickens, Jack London, Mary Shelley, Mark Twain - classics. And I loved them. But mom was concerned that such a steady diet of comics might be... I don't know. Too low-brow? Rotting my brain? I was her eldest child, so she worried about such things! She went to my teacher, who asked to see what I was reading. When I handed them over, he laughed and told my mother, ""First of all, she's reading comic adaptations of some of the greatest literature ever written - it's hardly all POW and BAM. Secondly, I'm just glad she's *reading*. Let her read the back of the cereal box, who cares?""Mom relaxed a little after that. I still have all those comics... they're still brilliant.;I owe a lot of my adult reading philosophies to my mother, in good ways and bad... I still worry about reading things that are ""low-brow"" (I hid the Harry Potter books for *ages*, until it became socially acceptable for adults to read them!) and my mother will still scoff if she finds ""trash"" on the Kindle (it's technically my Kindle, but I gave it to her so she could read between her school bus routes, since I can access the account from my computer. It's a fine arrangement, as we like to read a lot of the same things - but it does mean I hesitate before acquiring anything I might hear about later!).I too was easily scared as a child (still can't watch horror films), but my mother took the opposite approach - the day I got my library card, she handed over a note to the librarian that said I wasn't to be barred from any part of the library and I wasn't to have any of my selections questioned under any circumstances. The librarian looked at her a bit askance (I was 4, iirc) but agreed to keep it on file. I asked mom why she would bother with such a note, since, at four, I had little desire to venture too far beyond the children's section.She told me that when she was nine, she had tried to check To Kill a Mockingbird out of the very same library, and had been barred from doing so by the head librarian (this being just after it was published, when such a novel was considered to be *highly* subversive). She went home and told her father, who marched up to the library and demanded to know exactly why his daughter was being barred from reading *anything*, because an educated populace was something to celebrate, and surely she wasn't questioning his ability to parent by making decisions about his child's education for him, etc etc. (My grandfather on my mother's side is probably from whence my more revolutionary side comes!) The librarian handed the book over, and my grandfather told my mother, ""I can't give you half what I'd like to... but I'll be damned if I'll ever let anyone tell you what you can *read*. There are some difficult things in this book, and some of them you might not be ready for. You don't have to read them if you don't want to. If you do read them, come to me if you need to talk about them."" He died a few years later. When he did, mom realized that the greatest gift he'd ever given her was the notion that no book is ""bad,"" because books are meant to foster discussion. She vowed to raise her kids the same way.In the main, she succeeded. My greatest worry as a kid (and now!) regarding my reading material is that she'll comment that a book is ""beneath (my) capabilities""... but she never told me not to read anything, or that I ""shouldn't"" read anything. She just prefers I spend my time reading books that make me think.... which does not at all exclude popular modern novels. We both read everything from King to biographies to mystery novels to Plato - I introduced her to the Temeraire series and Harry Potter, she introduced me to Stieg Larsson. Our conversations often begin, ""You *have* to read this!!!""It's not a watertight philosophy, mind you, as she found out when I was about nine and came to her with a Judy Blume book in my hand. ""Mom, the main character keeps talking about something going up. What's he talking about?""To her credit, her reply was, ""Hang on just a minute. I need a cigarette for this conversation!""There were plenty of times I accidentally scared myself silly (John Bellairs ""The Eyes of the Killer Robot"" was the source of not a few nightmares), but my parents were smart enough to turn even those into literary discussions - why is having your eyes taken scary? Why eyes, in particular? It must be said that my father was in no way on board with the ""read anything you like"" plan. He liked his sleep!;Kathleen, that's an interesting question!What inspired me to keep reading... I think part of it was a love of word play. Both of my parents love word play, puns, double entendres, and words that are just plain fun to say, so I was raised with a lot of that. Instead of saying ""Time for dinner,"" my father would announce, ""Time to masticate some comestibles,"" and I had no idea that wasn't how everyone announced a meal was ready until I was well into primary school. :) Some of it was undoubtedly because I was shy (books were friends without that complicated making friends bit), and some of it was because with books, I could go anywhere, regardless of how laid up I might be in real life (four full summers in leg casts from hips to toes). I'm positive some of my ""read everything I can get my hands on immediately if not sooner"" philosophy came out of those miserable summers. I might not have survived with my sanity intact without the library!Having said all that, my sister grew up in the exact same environment - leg casts included, though not as many times - and couldn't possibly care less about books. She's a visual learner and a pictorial thinker (she was stunned to learn I think in *words,* and now thinks anyone who does is *irredeemably* strange) so while she enjoys being read *to* for short periods, she'd really rather watch a video or draw a picture. We're both well into adulthood now, but the pattern was evident from the time we were very small.;I can't decide if the notion of having two of my father in the world would be a good or a bad thing - not sure the planet could handle it!Ah, brain fog. It's slowed my reading significantly, too. First inkling I had that something might be wrong was at uni, when I found myself reading the same page over and over and understanding *nothing*... it felt like I was trying to read a language in which I knew all the words but had no idea how they went together. Turned out to be RA, so now I get brain fog from the RA *and* from the meds used to keep my joints from eating themselves! Reading on a high contrast monitor helps.... sometimes.My sister has autism and a lot of learning difficulties, and finds reading easier if she uses a yellow overlay. On the rare occasions she picks up a book, we can tell she's actually been reading it because it's got a sheet of yellow plastic stuck in.;I am just a fellow student, so my answer is not in any way official. Here is my opinion.Generally, personal feelings are not put into a literature essay. Personal *thoughts* are, that is, your personal view of what the text is trying to say. But not personal feelings, like ""I think these tales are scary,"" or ""these tales scared me as a child.""However, you can discuss your feelings indirectly, by saying something like ""Grimm's tales instill fear in children by dealing with topics such as death, loss, abuse,"" and so on. One of the hardest things for me about writing literary essays is sounding declarative, instead of as though I am only offering my opinion!That said, if I were peer reviewing an essay with personal content in it, I would probably not take points off as long as the personal content related to the thesis statement. It is probably worth asking yoursel"
FALSE,St12,Coh1,3,0,1,32,33.4979,0.955283,12,0,12,0.014689266,0,"Sean, on the whole, I completely agree. I have never been heavily into fantasy or sci-fi, but only because I'm a very eclectic reader who will read anything put in front of me (so I'm not really ""heavily"" into *anything*); when I do, though, I am usually impressed and gratified by what I find.It's funny, you're not the first person on this thread who's mentioned that we don't necessarily have to share attributes to relate to the characters or appreciate the story (including appreciating the time period in which it was written and/or set, whether we are comfortable with it or not). I agree with that, too. Lest that be a confusing statement coming from me after all the pontification above, I'll unpack it a little (n.b.: None of this is directed at any one person in particular, just some general observations on my part): I think often when these conversations arise, people who have rarely been bothered by representation in literature have a difficult time understanding the perspective of those who *are* bothered. There's a mistaken impression that we're incapable of enjoying anything that ever hits a misstep, and/or that we go *looking* for things to rant about.Nothing could be further from the truth. If you talk to people who like to discuss problematic representation (or total lack of representation) in the media, or who like to deconstruct attitudes in literature over time, we are usually the most ardent defenders of preserving historical texts as written, and of books/shows we love dearly even when they *are* problematic. Generally, it's the people who try to speak *for* us who want book burnings, whitewashing of texts, and refuse to read/watch/discuss anything that doesn't portray everyone in society as absolutely equal. I think the sanitization of literature is a crime, quite frankly. I read *to feel things*. I would much rather read a good book with some problematic content that upsets me, than read one that the political correctness police have had a go at. It's just that sometimes I get smacked with a prejudice that I wasn't in a good mental place to handle... but that doesn't mean I don't recognize the right of that art to exist. As a corollary to that, I know few people who read *only* fiction involving social minorities. I tend not to associate with those people, because their narrow view of the world doesn't suit me. :) Some of my favorite books in the world have no minorities in them whatsoever; I find other ways in which to identify with them. We are all more than the sum of our parts, and at the end of the day, we're all human.   Good writing trancends all identity labels. Also, as a writer I believe that writing exists to speak truth. Ugly truths are not excepted. Fiction is the mirror humanity holds up to itself, but that mirror is  only engaging and useful if it reflects *some* kind of truth. As a matter of fact, ugly truths are probably the most important ones to address.... almost always, when I find myself having an issue with a *modern* novel/tv show/film, it's because it's addressed an ugly truth *badly*. Most of the time I can find my way to giving an A for effort. Some days, not so much; it's more to do with my own mental state at the time than the actual words. As an example, since you reference Doctor Who (one of three television shows that I have ever watched *religiously*): Recently, I found myself *adoring* The Crimson Horror episode, after years of bitterly complaining about Moffat's showrunning and tinny, problematic scripts. For the first time since The Doctor's Wife, I felt like it was ""my show"" again. By the very end, I was watching through my fingers - not because I was scared, but because I was waiting for Gatiss to ruin the episode for me by giving in to one of the oldest tropes in the book (if you've seen it, you know what I mean... the long, slow closeup on the alien element at the end)... and then he subverted it, with relish. I punched the air in delight.... and trepidation. Waiting for *another* of the oldest tropes in the book... And then he subverted *that*, too. Honest to God, I teared up. There were so many ways that episode could have gone wrong from the perspective of portraying a disabled character, and Gatiss sidestepped them all. Or so I thought. Then I began reading over other people's impressions, and realized I'd completely missed all the instances of ""male gaze"" in the episode (Moffat just can't help himself!) Didn't ruin it a bit for me. (Spoilers!) Sure, it's problematic that The Doctor would grab a woman (and a woman whom he knows is a lesbian) for a very inappropriate kiss. On rewatch, it bothers me a little, simply because it's so unnecessary (likewise the sonic screwdriver gag in the same scene), and it's a cheap laugh that could've been got another, better way.... as played, it feels *grabby* and *intrusive*. (Men often get this wrong, because it plays well in fiction for men to be aggressive and grabby with women, sexual orientation irrelevant. Trouble is, most women have had experiences like that in *real life*, and in real life, being suddenly, nonconsensually grabbed by a man - even a man you know and trust - is scary as hell.) In isolation, the scene is light and maybe amusing, but when you stack it against the other creepy behavior toward women Moffat endorses, it's just ew... especially as Doctor Who is a family show, so there are small children, particularly small boys, who are seeing this and thinking that's how a ""real man"" behaves around women/gets the girl. Like it or not, TV is the biggest shaper of culture, and while no one message will affect a kid, boys get *bombarded* with those messages.... Be aggressive. Grabbing a woman is okay if you're ""just joking."" Grabbing a woman is okay if she doesn't scream or smack you. Women secretly want to be ordered around, dragged around or thrown around, because it's sexy and proves you are masculine. No means yes. If you didn't mean to hurt her/scare her, then she has no right to be upset. Good intentions are enough. The aware guys of the world, which I do think is most of them, quickly come to understand that these messages are bull. But it's a lot of baggage to lay on them and then say, ""Now, don't *ever* act like everyone you see on TV."" It's setting boys (who will one day be men) up to fail, I think, and that's no more fair to the boys than to the girls (who get the opposite damaging messages: Be passive. Don't hurt anyone's feelings. If he didn't mean it, then you're oversensitive to be bothered by it. You have little to no right to your own personal space, especially if the person encroaching on that space is male.) It's little wonder that men and women have such difficulty communicating; we're not from different planets, we just get messages from society that set us up to not communicate!Anyway, to return to The Crimson Horror (spoilers, again): I read a little further in the discussion threads and found, on a feminist blog that claims to celebrate intersectionality (that is, be sensitive to the fact that there are many different types of minorities in the world, and we won't always have the same feelings/needs), the following bit of a post, paraphrased: ""I don't understand why The Doctor didn't just cure Ada at the end of the episode. Surely he has the technology. His cruelness in leaving her blind was shocking. She'll never amount to anything trying to function like that in Victorian society. She saved him and that's how he repays her?"" I still haven't responded to that comment, and I probably won't. Besides demonstrating that just because one is a social minority, it doesn't make one immune to saying incredibly hurtful and ignorant things, it hammered home the idea that we have a long way to go - intersectionality is a great buzz word, but right now, it's still mostly a buzz word. Trying to explain the problems with that comment to a non-disabled person is often quite literally like trying to describe colors to a person who has never been able to see, and weeks later, I'm still not up for trying to explain to that (I'm sure, very well-meaning) person exactly why her comment is deeply offensive, and then, no doubt, end up in a poo-flinging match about why it's okay for a *blind* person to say something like that, but not a sighted person. (Why? Because life's not fair, that's why. Just like I can and do call myself a cripple and a gimp, but if an ablebodied person does so, they are quite likely to find their ankles clipped by my front casters.)As usual, I digress. You are entirely correct that fantasy and sci-fi often get it right more than they get it wrong, and also that portrayal of minorities (or two-hearted Time Lords!) should never sacrifice story just to make a point about diversity.   When writers do that, they come across as lecturing, and it's not pretty. I actually don't find it hard to avoid minority issues eating the plot at *all*, but then, I've been doing it all my life. I'm sure it's harder for people who are less aware of minority points of view. Really, though, no one expects everyone to know everything - we can each only write from our own experiences and interests - but avoiding being preachy or worse, desperately wrong/offensive is easily solved by simply *asking* someone of the minority you're trying to portray - preferably *before* your writing is finalized!I am deeply ambivalent about Flowers for Algernon. It's an important book, no doubt, and a good one, and I'm glad it's out there. I still have my copy. But I have to be in the right mood to read it, because as with a lot of fiction that tries to tackle disability but is written by a non-disabled author, the ""got it just right"" bits are a thrill and the missteps are glaring. (My sister functions at a level similar to Charlie's ""natural"" state, so she and I have had many discussions about it.);Funny you should mention that. I was going to bring up the whole ""besides, the Doctor is asexual!"" thing, but I never know how people will react! Ten is ""my Doctor,"" but even speaking from that perspective, I found his relationship with Rose... I don't know. Strange? Out of character? Inexplicable? None of which was anything to do with *Rose*, whom I liked on the whole. It just seemed bizarre to me that a man as old as the Doctor, who has experienced things many orders of magnitude beyond what any human could ever experience (even human assistants/companions), would fall in love with a human in the *way* that he was depicted to have done with Rose. RTD's explanation for it is rather brilliant, though, I admit... he says that due to the circumstances surrounding the regeneration, the Doctor sort of *imprinted* on Rose, like a chick from an egg (thus the similar accents!) I still don't *like* it, but that makes the whole Ten/Rose thing make more sense to me (imo, Nine/Rose was a lot more one-sided... Ten/Rose was when the Doctor started to reciprocate in a more-than-platonic way.) Of course, Moffat then took the imprinting idea to openly creepy territory, but that's a whole other rant.I think the next Doctor will be male, too. I'm okay with that. Actually, I'm hoping and praying we'll get Ben Daniels. He's not an extra young fella, but he's easily passed for a mid-30s ""look"" in other recent shows he's done. Don't even get me started on River.... *so* much potential at introduction, and then it's all flushed down the bog! River is a perfect example of how all of Moffat's female characters have their agency ripped away from them in favor of their entire lives revolving around the Doctor. He did it with Reinette, then Sally Sparrow, then River, then Amy, now Clara. Every one of them ends up trapped in a timey-wimey situation where their actions are predestined. The first few times, it was an interesting idea. At this point, I just roll my eyes. Another woman, another cookie-cutter ""feisty girl"" who lives solely to serve The Doctor and his ends.Doctor Who is never off topic, to my mind... certainly not in a class like this!;Faith, that's a good point. Part of the reason Ten is ""my"" Doctor, even though I've seen them all, is because I find Ten's emotional range so fascinating... I know some people think Tennant chewed the scenery, but I loved that he could go from cheeky to despondent to having a geeky moment to coldly furious all in the same episode. From that point of view, it does make sense that a Doctor who feels things so deeply would also fall in love.... and since Rose was the catalyst for that regeneration (in crude terms, the woman who ""taught him how to feel again,"") it also makes sense that he would fall in love with her. Thanks for that.A lot (not all, but I'd say 50% or so) of the ""but the Doctor is asexual!"" comments I see do in fact come *from* asexual fans, who aren't so much upset with Who as they are crying out for representation; they feel like putting the Doctor in the ""sexual"" box has just ripped away one of the characters they can most relate to. (Moffat's snarky comments about asexuality being ""boring"" don't help on that front.) As one who identified as asexual for many years (cause I sure as hell wasn't a straight woman, and I wasn't a lesbian, and I didn't know what that left other than asexual, because *nobody*, including me, was going to touch me *anywhere* if I could help it - gender dysphoria is a barrel of fun, especially when you have no idea what it is!), I can sympathize with their point.I like Clara and River too, they both just make me so *sad* with what Moffat's done to them... River had bucketloads of personality (love her or hate her, no one's ambivalent!) and then it turned out none of that *personality* even belonged to her, let alone the events of her life... and poor Clara was written from the start as a plot device, a tabula rosa to fulfill Moffat's ""brilliant"" storyline. It's such a shame.I'm in favor of such a class; as long as we're not unraveling the base code of the universe, which was the first thought that came to mind when you said that! :);Moffat has been a festering turd re: bisexuality, too. He said that River is bisexual on his Twitter, and a fan commented along the lines of ""er, how were we supposed to know that, exactly?"" and he went off on this rant about how it wasn't his responsibility to include diverse characters (except for the LOLs), and besides, bisexual people were probably too busy shagging to watch Who anyway, so anyone that's bothered should shut up. The whole brouhaha made me glad that, while Moffat may have been the one to ""invent"" Jack, RTD was the one *shaping* Jack's character... because RTD got it right, on the whole. As you say, not perfect, but Jack is well rounded, interesting, and bisexuality is only *one* part of his character... that one trait doesn't swallow all the other things Jack is. And when you can get that *balance* right, you can go for the cheap joke once in a while.RTD's work is quite interesting from a sexuality perspective because he threw a concept into sharp relief in Queer as Folk (he was the original author, as QaF started in the UK). Stuart Jones (Brian Kinney in the US version) is selfish, vain, abusive, and sex obsessed (at least in the beginning). He uses drugs, parties all night, doesn't believe in relationships, and has sex with every guy he can get his hands on. In short, he's every possible stereotype about gay men that the straight world has, all rolled into one character. Thing is, everyone who moves in LGBTQ circles *knows someone* like that! (Ugly truth being reflected.) So why does it ""work,"" instead of coming off as an offensive stereotype? Two reasons: One, Stuart/Brian experiences character growth, which gives him a *depth* of character. Two, he's not *the* gay character in the show.... so he is not held up as ""absolute truth,"" just one uncomfortable example of it. In QaF, RTD achieved that well-roundedness by showing *more than one example* of what it means to be a gay man, both amongst the cast and through character development. And that's why *more* representation is the key to the whole problem. The more women and minority characters we get in our fiction, the broader the overall portrait becomes, and then it's not necessarily jarring or offensive to have a stereotypical minority character, because there are other examples (preferably in the same work, or at least the same universe). When a white straight man acts stereotypically, no one comes away from that thinking ""all white straight men behave that way."" But when a minority character acts stereotypically, most of the audience will accept that as the only way that character could possibly have been written, because they think ""all"" people of that minority *do* behave in that way... unless the author gives them some other example to counter the stereotype.So it's not that no one can ever write a stereotypical minority character... it's that if you're going to do that responsibly, you need to have counterexamples. And if you don't want to bother with counterexamples, but you want to write responsibly, then you need to be careful to avoid the stereotype.;Yes he does. And I agree - RTD (and John Barrowman) got the ""tone"" around Jack's character exactly right... which is why it's funny. Tone is a funny thing when it comes to writing... it can swing your point from valid to ridiculous or humorous to offensive in one fell swoop. I don't think it's a coincidence that the tone was right and Jack was played by a gay actor and the bulk of his character written by a gay writer. It's not that a straight actor and a straight writer *couldn't* have nailed the tone, or that being gay and being bisexual are equivalent - but sexual minorities generally *inherently* understand the subtleties of tone regarding sexual minorities as a whole, whereas straight writers/actors have to do some mental gymnastics (and probably some checking-with-people-of-that-minority) to understand how to strike the right tone. It's the same with disability - none of my current characters actually have *my* disability, or anything remotely like it. But because I'm ""culturally disabled"" (in the same way that one can be ""culturally Jewish"" - that is, culturally aware of what it's like to be disabled, the importance of my tone, and how to hit the emotions I'm going for vis-a-vis disability), when I ran my writing past those who *do* have the same disability as the characters, they replied, ""What are you checking with *me* for? This is fine."" Hitting the right tone required no massive effort on my part, even regarding a completely different disability, because I ""speak the language"" in both a specific sense (my personal disabilities) and a broader sense (navigating the world as a disabled person in general). That ability is the same reason I can watch something Marlee Matlin is in and know instantly whether the director/writer consulted with *her* regarding portrayal of a Deaf person, or whether they thought they knew better than she does. I'm not Deaf, but being disabled gives me an innate ""feel"" for tone in that area. It's not impossible to make mistakes (which is why it's still important to check!), but it's always easier to hit the right tone when your experiences give you an innate sense of the tone you're aiming for, and what to avoid.I think your examples of bigotry were spot on, no worries. And Stuart/Brian is my favorite character, too. In the end, he was the character with the *most* depth, I think!I agree, too, that a female doctor would be brilliant, but Moffat is *not* the one to tackle it. He has only one way he thinks of women, and a giant chip on his shoulder about how ""men get no respect"" - which, I'm sure, is why he's so lousy at writing women. When you approach writing about something outside your realm of experience with disdain or resentment, it's not going to go well. I liked how Neil Gaiman referenced the possibility of fluid genders within regenerations (the Corsair in The Doctor's Wife), but I think it needs to stay there until Moffat's out, and preferably, until they have more female writers on staff. Right now, that number is zero, and it shows. (RTD didn't do much better on that score, it must be said - under him, there was *one* female Who writer.);I have always loved the Alice stories, though, as a child, I did not care for Alice herself! I remember wishing she would be a little more agreeable and thoughtful towards all of the other characters and their delightful word play. Reading it again as an adult, I am struck by the realization that Alice herself certainly likes wordplay, but she seems to only recognize it as such when *she* is engaging in it. When the other characters play with words in return, she is vexed, puzzled, and irritated.On that note, I wonder how the wordplay translates to the non-native English speakers in this class - is it fun to discover new meanings, or do all the shifting meanings make it difficult to figure out what the characters are saying?;Certainly, I think it would be a fascinating thread of its own! Go ahead. :)I think it was the wordplay itself - both the shifting meanings, and the fact that many of the poems are fun to recite. For lack of a better way to describe it, the words *feel* good... I used to spend hours rolling them around on my tongue and in my head, contemplating how many ways one could say them and how each different way one said them might have a different meaning. (It is probably no surprise that I became a writer!) I love many of the ideas around words in the books - how the same word can mean different things, how one's choice of words matters, how words can bring ideas (and sometimes entire things!) into existence or wipe them away. The Alice stories are paradise for anyone who likes to play with the English language or think about the importance of all languages.;Agreed. Jane Yolen is also the *master* at modern retellings of fairy tales! She knows of which she speaks.;I would not want the job of trying to translate either of the Alice stories into another language. Both books are heavily dependent on wordplay, specifically *English* wordplay. All languages *have* wordplay, enjoy the concept, and engage in it, but not using the same words. Trying to find *one* word in any other language that has the *same* double/triple/quadruple etc meaning as its English equivalent would be a difficult task... trying to find *lots* of different words, all of which have the same multiple meanings to their respective English equivalent, strikes me as nigh impossible.I've read ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" in both English and Irish - they feel like very different books, even though the story is the same and there is little wordplay. Because any given translated word will have slightly different connotations from the word in the original language, translating a book can completely alter the *feel* of it... even when it is a very good translation (as I would argue the Harry Potter Irish translation is). I can only imagine how skilled any translator would need to be to even *contemplate* translating Lewis Carroll... and surely, the meanings of bits like Jabberwocky are quite literally lost in translation, as they are entirely made of portmanteau *English* words.I suspect that is why it would be very easy to find the Alice stories ""boring"" in any other language. I have read certain Chinese tales and found them dull or incomprehensible despite good translations - only to realize that the layer I was missing was all the wordplay that works perfectly well in Mandarin, but for which there simply *is* no equivalent in English - at least, not without pages and pages of annotation to ""explain the joke!"";Anonymous, keep in mind that peer reviews are assigned randomly for each essay. By ""tightening"" your grading, you will quite likely end up punishing people who had nothing to do with the first round of reviews you got. I understand that you are hurt and I understand why, but because there is no easy way to converse directly with the people who actually give out unfair grades, it may be best to continue treating others as you yourself would like to be treated.I checked those spelling and grammar check sites out too, and was told I had 30+ ""critical"" errors... my writing is hardly without fault, but it's worth noting that I'm a writer by profession, have been published, and have been writing in English, my native tongue, for 28 years. In short, two or three errors, I could believe... 30+ ""critical"" errors in 320 words, I would have noticed! I'm fairly sure my peers would have too, and I got a 4.5. I don't know what those sites are calibrated toward (the suggestion of junior high, students age 11-14, sounds about right - or maybe very simple sentences for businesspeople traveling abroad), but many of the corrections they suggest are simply not correct at all, especially regarding things like subject-verb agreement. I suspect they are more of a hindrance than a help when it comes to a class such as this.I can understand how that might make you feel not sure what to trust or what resources to use. However, I'm equally sure that I'm not the only fellow student who would be willing to proofread your work and offer suggestions... this is a big class, rich in *human* resources!There is a Facebook group for this class here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/246393752160589Should you choose to join it, I'm sure you can find some fellow students who would be happy to help you out - I would be one of those people.;You have 24 pigs and 4 corrals (or pens, or boxes, or fenced in areas, whatever you like). The four pens are arranged along a circular path. Arrange the pigs in the pens so that if you walk from the first pen, to the second, to the third, to the fourth, and back around to the first, the number of pigs in the pen you are walking toward will always be nearer to ten than the one you are leaving.A little hint: Because this is a puzzle from Lewis Carroll, the solution is not purely mathematical - there is some wordplay involved. So, think about the wording of the question itself.;Sorry that happened to you, Andrew. Utterly unwarranted, as others have said. I distrust plagiarism checkers on the whole, because they tend to have a difficult time discerning a legitimately cited quotation from actual plagiarizing; they can be a good *tool* if you've been trained how to use a particular one, but using one is not as simple as pasting in the material and anything over 5-10% gets automatically called plagiarism. As with a lot of automation, a human has to check over what the computer came up with and make some intelligent decisions about the data.I was in a coursera class where plagiarism - quite blatant plagiarism, with 1000 word blocks of text lifted directly from a single website - was a big issue. We were specifically instructed to grade on content, and not form, grammar, spelling or syntax, because it was a public health class and no one (including those of us with good written English skills) wanted the non-native speakers to be at any more of a disadvantage than they would already be by taking a course in their non-native tongue. We were also given two weeks to write each essay, so the ""limited time"" issue wouldn't be so much of a barrier. In other words, the incentive to plagiarize should have been low. Yet, by the fifth round of essays, it was still going on (I saw several such essays with my own eyes)... very frustrating for the people who did the work. And, of course, there were the false plagiarism accusations, too.With that under my belt, the tack I choose to take is this   - I don't even bring it up unless I am *positive*. And by positive, I mean I can say, ""this section is plagiarized from this site (link) and this section is from this site (link), and you added little/no content of your own."" Yeah, that means some people probably slip by me. I won't say that doesn't bother me, but it would bother me a whole lot more to falsely accuse someone of plagiarism.Consider, too, that since this is an online class, the most likely way for a student to plagiarize is by using google.... which means if they copied large chunks of text, you can find them the same way the peer found the essay in the first place.   If an essay really looks ""too good to be true"", googling a few lines should be sufficient to give you an idea.But please, please be careful about assuming that just because someone writes well, they must not have written it themselves. Taking *that* attitude just punishes the best writers in the class, whom we should want to learn from!;Stephanie, oh my god, you're *right*! Totally missed the Disraeli/Gladstone reference, and now that you've pointed it out, I don't see how anyone who knows that particular bit of history could *possibly* miss it! Brilliant - thanks.;My favorite is still ""Because Poe wrote on both."" It is certainly not an answer that would be given by the Wonderland characters, but it has the same sense of playful-but-somewhat deep wordplay that Carroll so enjoyed.;Suzanne, it's funny how bringing different personal experiences to the readings can result in entirely different ""take away"" messages, even when two people have similar personalities. Like you, I am a very sensitive person. I can't watch horror. I have to be very very careful what kind of horror I *read*, and what time of day I read it (I love Stephen King, but only in the daytime, and I still haven't made it all the way through some of his darker stuff like ""The Shining."") I can't even handle ""funny"" horror like the Scary Movie series, cause it just scares me witless. I read a lot of historical literature, historical accounts, and lightly fictionalized historical accounts, some of which are a million times worse than anything King could come up with, but with those, I've always overcome my tendency to freak myself out by reminding myself that I have a responsibility to know what has come before me in the world (that's just my take, because my parents very much raised me that way. We're a little eccentric.)But A Modest Proposal made me *cry* with laughter. Not because I think eating babies is funny, but because as a life long student of Irish history, I find Swift's piece to be one of the most snarky, dripping-with sarcasm pieces of satire ever written. It reads as a howling protest, a thumbing of the nose, a ""You bloody tyrants want us wiped off the map, eh? (true, at the time!) I bet your next proposal will be *this*!"" And yet for all its scathing critique, it is of course delivered in (mostly) Parliament-appropriate language, heaped with a ridiculous amount of decorum, and you can just imagine it *actually* being a speech given at the House of Lords vis-a-vis ""The Irish Problem"".It wasn't, of course. But the things happening in that time period made you wonder if maybe, someday...Swift meant for A Modest Proposal to be *read* as a scathing critique of the British government's treatment of Ireland in his time. Unfortunately, he wrote such a good, over the top, pointed, erudite piece of satire, that even then, most people read it as comedy rather than political message.I can see how, devoid of the context in which it was written, A Modest Proposal looks like the macabre fantasies of someone who isn't in his right mind. *Within* context, though, the meaning becomes something altogether different.;The Stand is probably my favorite King book (""On Writing"" excepted, since that's more a biography/writing advice book, albeit one of the best on the market, imo). Closely following that are In the Eyes of the Dragon, Rose Madder, and 11/22/63. I find it interesting that King himself never thought much of Rose Madder... while there are some gory bits, to me, it's one of the best anti-domestic violence novels out there.On Writing is absolutely fantastic for anyone who thinks they even might like to write some day. You don't have to like King's work to find it extraordinarily useful and very refreshing in its approach. Rather than droning on for pages about vocabulary, he simply says, use your own vocabulary, whatever it may be. By all means, expand your vocabulary, enjoy words, but when you're actually sitting down to write: ""One of the really bad things you can do to your writing is to dress up the vocabulary, looking for long words because you're maybe a little bit ashamed of your short ones. This is like dressing up a household pet in evening clothes.""Then there's this gem, regarding Strunk and White. After praising the manual highly, he adds, ""{Strunk and White have} ideas about where it's best to place the most important parts of a sentence. They say at the end, and everyone's entitled to "
FALSE,St12,Coh1,4,0,1,29,34.8189,0.832882,10,0,10,0.01710731,0,"Rebecca, if I recall correctly, Stephen King deconstructs that statement quite a bit in his memoir/writing advice book (it's called ""On Writing,"" and if you haven't read it, it's worth a look!). He provides lots of tips and tricks that have worked for him, but in the end, the main takeaway from his book is, ""Write however *you* write. As long as you know the rules, you can break the rules. There is no right or wrong way to craft a story, unless you're not being true to your own 'voice'."";Rebecca, yes, completely agreed. I think in this particular course, taking into consideration the wide range of experience (and English proficiency) of our peers, having an explicit statement is vital. A skilled writer can have an implied statement when the exact audience and purpose of the writer is relatively uniform.... that is, if a skilled writer is writing for an audience of equally skilled readers, concerning a topic that both groups are invested in. That's not necessarily the case here - our backgrounds, experience levels, and comfort levels with the written English language vary widely. Our audience and purpose is to write insightfully for the attentive, intelligent reader.... and that's it. Given that, we can't make assumptions about any *further* things our audience is bringing to the table, other than being attentive, intelligent, and looking for insight. It's only fair to include an explicit thesis, to give *all* of our peers something to hang their hats on, so to speak. There are a few different benefits to having an explicit thesis in a class like this.1) If the person writing the essay is not 100% confident in their written English skills, having an explicit thesis can make it easier to understand what they are trying to say, despite potential grammar errors. I try to give non-native speakers the benefit of the doubt in any way I can, and if they have an explicit thesis, I can usually ""decode"" the rest; making it more likely that I will score them highly. If I can't understand what they are trying to explore, I can't be enlightened or have my reading enriched! Clear, explicit thesis = easier to understand and evaluate.2) If the person *reading* the essay is not 100% confident in their written English skills, having an explicit thesis makes it easier for the peer evaluator to understand what the writer is discussing. The end result is the same no matter which side the English deficit (or tiredness of the reader/writer, or rush of the reader/writer) is on - clear, explicit thesis = easier to understand and evaluate.3) Whether you have an explicit or an implicit thesis, it's very difficult to formulate a thesis if it's not explicit in your own *head*. That being the case, and the word limit and diversity of the audience being what it is, it's probably best to express the thesis in its clearest, most explicit form.... since you (general you) should have that in your head, anyway.;For Grimm, I put two hours' time into 5 reviews, and most of that was typing feedback. For Alice, it was only an hour or so of typing (I was ill, meant to come back and add more suggestions/examples, and ran out of time). But I try to put at *least* fifteen minutes into every essay, not counting reading time. The way I see it, it's one of the most important aspects of class. If I'm criticizing something, I owe it to that peer to provide specifics and examples for how they can do better. If I'm praising something, I owe it to them to be specific about what I'm praising and why. And every peer deserves at least one bit of criticism and one bit of praise for form, and the same for content. It's the only kind of feedback we're going to get from this course, so the least I can do is to try to make sure my feedback is thoughtful, helpful, concrete, and of good quality.I'm not necessarily *limiting* myself to five reviews, by the way.... but so far, I haven't had time to give more than five essays the attention they deserve. I hope to have the time to go above the mandatory five at least a few times over the course of this class.;Oh, and by the way, Agamemnon, you've got a superfluous apostrophe in your thread title. Just in case that was another test. ;)Nice username, though.;Anonymous, NBC and MSNBC have been doing a pretty good job of covering it in the past day or two. It's no doubt they're late to the game, as usual (BBC World News and The Guardian newspaper online have been reporting on it daily for several days now), but NBC and MSNBC have caught up enough to start a) covering it, b) showing footage of it and c) analyzing it, at least a little bit. I wouldn't dare to claim that I have anything close to a comprehensive knowledge of what's going on from my position in the US, but I was aware of the protests, the general causes of the protests, the police reaction, and the reporter Peter mentioned.;Only two things make me consider a 1:1) If, despite reading the essay several times, I can't understand what the writer is trying to say at *all*.   I am a very patient evaluator - I will point out flaws in grammar or punctuation, and provide corrections, but I won't mark down for them unless they make it difficult to read the essay. Similarly, if I can figure out what you're *trying* to say, I will base your content grade entirely on that - not on how well you phrased it. After all, our purpose is supposed to be to enrich each other's reading - if you do that, you get a 2 or a 3 from me. But if I can't understand you at all, then you can't enrich my reading. I understand that not everyone has fluent English-speakers available to look over their essays, but if you know you need a little help expressing yourself, reach out! If you don't know any English speakers in real life, there are many of them in this course. I am one of the many students who is more than happy to help. I won't write your essay for you, but I'll help you find the English equivalent for what you'd like to say. There are also many language specific threads on these boards... ask there, if you'd prefer, and see if your fellow multilingual students can help. :)2) If, after going over the essay several times, I still can't identify what your topic/thesis is. It's entirely possible to write an essay in perfect English, but not really *say* anything. Try to pick a specific topic for your thesis - one that says something interesting about the book. Provide a few examples of this one particular interesting idea in the book,   discuss those examples to help you make that point, and then add a brief conclusion. Read over your essay once you've finished it, and make sure you're not straying off into completely different topics. You don't have room to wander! The higher the number of *different* topics you discuss, the harder it is for an evaluator to figure out which one is your thesis.;Exactly. Home Rule and its consequences is a very, very, *very* complicated subject that encompasses history, religion, economics, socioeconomics, politics, and more. There is a reason that The Troubles are referred to even now with capital letters and in the present tense, 15 years after the Good Friday Agreement. It's all way outside the scope of this discussion, and I don't want to bore anyone, so I'll leave it there, except to say this: If you think it is, or ever was, as simple as Protestant vs. Catholic or Irish vs. British, or if you think it's all a historical conflict, not at all relevant to the modern world........ well, I'm not Northern Irish or British, so I don't have the right to speak for those who are.... but there are many, many, many lost lives, on *all* sides, over many years, who would have given *anything* for the situation to be that simple. And though *I* am not Northern Irish or British, some of those lost lives have belonged to friends of mine - people lost in *my* lifetime to that conflict... friends of mine on *all* sides. Some were lost or maimed before the internet, when all we had was 5 seconds of shaky footage on CNN to try to frantically identify familiar faces under the blood, and 20 hours to wait for the police to allow phone calls through again... sitting up till 3am waiting for the phone to ring, waiting to find out if we could exhale. Wondering which would be worse, the death of one of my friends my own age, or the death of one of their parents. (All deaths, of course, have been equally horrific, but those are the kinds of morbid ruminations that cross your mind when your family is silently huddled on the couch in the dead of night, thousands of miles away, wondering just how bad this night will end.... all the while knowing that even if *you* and *your* friends and loved ones are spared, someone else in the world - usually several someones, sometimes dozens of someones - are mourning theirs.)And some have been lost or maimed after the internet, the news trickling in through sudden text messages, some heartstoppingly vague - ""bomb again..."" I learned to type ""Where? Is everyone alright?"" in a matter of seconds with only my thumbs. And then wait that same wait, shorter now, but still with my heart in my shoes, waiting for the rest.And you can only go through so many years of that before you no longer remember how to exhale. Not all the way. Not quite. The whole mad business no longer has ""sides"" when you reach that point, and life becomes an eternity of the calm before the storm. If you're lucky, when we're all lucky, it stays that way... for a little while. In your gut, you know there will more than likely be a next time.And that's the perspective of someone who is only, and has only ever been, on the outermost fringes of the experience.Like I said - it's complicated.Whatever Stoker's religion, he was an Irishman living in London. In his time, that was a *deeply* alienating experience. Depending on exactly where you're from and exactly where you go, that can still be true today (as can the reverse)... for the same core reasons, and due to the same old wounds that are not nearly as old as they seem.;I think as long as you are making a solid argument about *one* clear idea, you can write about whatever you want and get a good grade. I've had a few comments along those lines too, and the way they're usually phrased is, ""I would have liked to hear more about ____, but I understand we're all working under a tight word limit."" If that's the kind of comment you're seeing, take it as a compliment; you have ""hooked"" the reader, and they're interested in hearing more!If, on the other hand, the kind of comment you're getting is, ""I would have liked to have heard more about _____ instead of (second topic you strayed into,)"" that is a gentle nudge from your peers that perhaps you could have written an essay that was more focused on your thesis. Under such a limited word count, we have to be very careful to make sure we're discussing *one* idea in depth. If you discuss even *two* different ideas in your essay - even if they seem closely related to you - you simply won't have the room to explore either of them in a meaningful way.;Anonymous, you're welcome.That's a difficult question. I might be able to give you a better answer if I knew what your thesis was, and which facts you used - because it depends how closely your facts were related to your thesis.For example, let's say you wrote about the depiction of childhood in Alice, and you said that portrait of childhood was represented by wordplay, Alice's emotional growth, and the structure of the story itself (Alice's evolution from child to Queen). That would be a very good thesis for a paper that is a page or two long, but it's too much to cover in 270-320 words. In a situation like that, I would narrow the thesis to *one* of those things, and make my thesis:""Carroll depicts the magical aspects of childhood through his vivid wordplay."" OR""Carroll explores childhood development through the emotional growth of Alice.""OR""Carroll uses Alice's evolution from child to Queen as an allegory for every child's journey to adulthood.""Basically, make sure you're not trying to cover too much in your thesis for the length you have available to you.It's also worth noting that there's no pleasing certain peer evaluators, so the best you can do is write what *you* think is a solid essay. :);Unfortunately, it doesn't really get better from that perspective. When I was studying Frankenstein in school, I found solace in focusing on the monster more than Victor. He is an infinitely more sympathetic character, in my mind.;Sean, I had a feeling if I didn't post about this passage, you might be the one who would! I guffawed. I'm not sure of the meaning of ""polyglot"" in this scene either - like you, I can guess, but I get the feeling I'm missing another pun. All of that said, this passage has finally solidified into a decent thesis for my essay, after *days* of trying to find a topic to which I can do justice. Now I just have to *write* the thing... with blood!;Rebecca, that's the dictionary definition of polyglot, of course, but I wondered if Van Helsing's *meaning* might be slightly different. I like Sean's guess - that the captain swore in a way that Van Helsing couldn't translate and/or understand (even if it was in English). That would point to a certain self-awareness in Van Helsing's character that we've seen elsewhere in the book... he would essentially be saying, ""The captain said many other things, and I could infer from his tone that he was swearing, but I couldn't make heads or tails of what language the swearing might have been in - it could have been languages with which I'm not familiar, or possibly he descended so far into slang/dialect that I couldn't follow."" There is a third interpretation, but it's what I've built my thesis around, so I'll post about it after the essay deadline. :);I agree, the dialects are theatrically overwritten, and as many have pointed out, often incorrect to boot. But I think Stoker was aiming at something altogether different in this *particular* passage... I may post my essay on this thread after the review period, for further consideration.;Coming here to voice a general complaint that 320 words is not enough to lay out a good persuasive paper on this thesis topic. Sigh. Oh well. It's not as eloquent as it was at 500 words, but hopefully it's still interesting.;I think every writer will have a different answer to your question. Here is mine:I have always struggled with deep literary analysis; it does not come naturally to me. As you say, I can analyze intuitively, on a general level, but actually deconstructing the text line by line to find other/greater meaning has always felt, to me, almost like unmaking a beautiful quilt. When done, I might have a greater appreciation for the stitching, but I no longer have a nice quilt - instead, I have a pile of beautiful pieces, each interesting in their own way, but no longer *complete*.However, I've been writing creatively since the age of four (I'm 31 now). I write for hours a day, every day; it's my greatest love. And indeed, I write intuitively. When I *re-write*, though, I often go back, look through what I've written, and try to subtly enhance any themes or symbolism which inadvertently made it into my creative flow. I make sure to do so in a way that doesn't ""break"" the story... they're just small elements that a reader can find if they're so inclined. If not, they still have a good story to read.I'm finding my literary analysis skills improving as we move through this course, and the short word limit is helping me crystallize complex thoughts in fewer words than I normally would. Whether that will show in my future creative writing, I'm not sure. Certainly, previous literature courses haven't inclined me to write more obviously or intricately symbolic books... so far, that's just not my style.But I do think a course like this helps writers think about why they write what they write, and how best to say what they want to say. It's not that one necessarily needs to answer the first question (it's perfectly okay for the answer to be ""because that's what I like""), but sometimes pondering those things can lead to interesting flashes of insight. It's always valuable to think about one's craft, even if it doesn't affect what you do or how you do it.;Again, this is just my own personal answer; I often find that analyzing a story so deeply *does* take some of the magic out of it for me. Interestingly, though, it seems to have happened less in this course, and I just put my finger on why this morning.In most ""formal"" literature courses, students are asked to write very long essays, and rarely get to hear the ideas of others (apart from the professor/teacher's interpretations, and perhaps those of other official scholars whose work the student cites). So, the combination of having to write a very long paper examining several different disparate elements, and the limited amount of input in terms of others' views, results in a sort of creative exhaustion regarding the book - at least, for me. I very much feel that way about Frankenstein. Having written a 15 page paper on it 15 years ago, I have less-than-zero desire to ever pick it up again - it is a pile of pieces to me, no longer an interesting story.In this course, however, we are limited to choosing one small aspect of the work, making a brief argument, and then we move on. Additionally, we get to see the brief insights our classmates also have, which are often different to our own, or touch on things we hadn't considered. And, because we are not subjected to any ""official"" interpretation by the professor until after we have written our own, we are free to explore as we will. The cumulative effect of all these small differences, to me, is that I'm not creatively exhausted by trying to analyze the book (because I've had to choose only one aspect and provide only a few examples), and reading my fellow classmates' broad range of insights often helps me ""re-quilt"" the book, while still appreciating it in new ways. So, yes, analyzing a book can ruin the experience of the book itself... but I think doing ""bite-sized"" analyses and having the opportunity to see a variety of other bite-sized analyses helps retain the magic of the original experience.As to a recommended way for authors to analyze stories... I don't think there is one. Because I'm an intuitive writer, I tend to analyze intuitively, too... and mostly subconsciously, at that. If a book touches me as a creative masterwork first - if, in other words, it tells me a good story - then I'll often find myself ruminating on what made it good, just in terms of a general statement that I can file away for future reference. Sometimes it's a structural/stylistic reason, like ""the author writes dialogue that rings in my ears for days,"" and sometimes it's an emotional reason, like ""I related to that character, even if I'm not sure why (and I might think about that further to try to uncover the why)"" and sometimes it's due to a bit of symbolism that I subconsciously latched onto that resonates with me. A *really* good book will do all three. An example of one of those, for me, is a book called Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha by Roddy Doyle. It's about a ten year old Dubliner coming of age in the 80s... and that's about it. There is nothing deeply symbolic about it, but it paints a vivid portrait of childhood that uses language that is true to life (i.e. the language used in the book is the language a ten year old boy from Dublin Ireland would use - a structural/stylistic choice that helps the story work), I related to the characters (as a person raised in the ex-pat Irish community, Paddy's parents and friends reminded me of my parents and my friends - an emotional reason the story worked for me), and, in the end, it is a ""loss of innocence"" story, but it's unique in that that loss of innocence is not presented as dark or sad or tragic... you close the book feeling that Paddy is changed, but that a slightly older, slightly wiser Paddy will go on to discover more exciting things about the world (both a structural/stylistic choice - the presentation of the theme as a positive element - and a symbolism choice, the loss of innocence itself). And having done that brief analysis just here and now, it's still one of my favorite books. Undoubtedly, if I tore it apart line by line, I could find more... but I have no desire to end up with a pile of pieces. :);""When we attempt to answer them as well, we end up with self-indulgent, heavy-handed monstrosities like Atlas Shrugged. :P""I literally laughed out loud. You've hit the nail on the head in more ways than one!I'm torn about Frankenstein at the moment - I loved it when I first read it, but writing that paper on it sucked every bit of life from the book for me. And that was with a very, *very* good English teacher who encouraged class discussion and *discouraged* the notion of any ""official"" way to look at the text. At the same time, I'm hoping that 15 years and the constraints of a 270-320 word essay this time around will help me look at it with fresh eyes. We shall see.;Dawn, good luck! I suffered through an entire year of Hawthorne back in high school because my English teacher had a crush on him. That's not hyperbole - she told us early and often that, ""If Nathaniel Hawthorne came back from the dead, I'd divorce my husband in a hot minute!""I found him *deadly* dull and predictable, but if you like your stories chock full of symbolism, you may have an altogether different opinion. :);LOL! I liked Hawthorne alright for a while, but I eventually burnt out on him and all of his favorite things, and I've remained so, sad to say. I can only take so much sin, hearts, red, ugliness-is-the-worst-thing-in-the-world, and the like. He had a very interesting perspective on the world, and he wasn't an unattractive man, but by the fifth straight month of him, I began to picture him as the nineteenth century equivalent of one of my many obnoxious classmates... the ones who would buttonhole me in the halls to tell me, at length and with great earnestness, that God was watching me and He loved me, but the wages of sin are death and if I didn't convert to their flavor of Christianity, I would never get to heaven. (I was first a liberal Protestant, then converted to Catholicism, and while I *never* discussed religion at school, that didn't matter... it was a small public school around the corner from a massive southern church which 99% of the student body attended, so they knew us by our absence, as it were.) Anyway, after a while,   Hawthorne took on that same feel for me... the earnest, intelligent, interesting guy who *always* brings everything back to the same subject in the end!Poe, on the other hand... rowr. As the kids are saying these days, ""I'd hit it."" :);Scott, that's not quite what I said. There's a reason I included the context in which I studied Hawthorne... the context affected how I saw the text, and I fully admit that. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to completely divorce any text from the context in which we have first read it. Not impossible, I grant you, but difficult, if we are honest with ourselves. Having been subjected to a solid nine months of studying Hawthorne (with no breaks or studying other authors in between), in an environment where my modern peers *were* preaching at me (it wasn't just me, by the way... it's a cultural/religious doctrine thing where I live, and that's okay) made all the religious notes of Hawthorne's work stand out to me. That's certainly not all there is to see in his work - believe me, nine months gives one a fairly good understanding of the breadth of what he wrote. I'm not planning on skipping Hawthorne for this course, so actually, I *will* be re-reading it.That doesn't change the fact that I'd honestly rather have a root canal. I am Hawthorne'd out. But I'll re-read his work, and write my essay, and try to find something new... which is what we are all here for, no?As for Poe, the list of authors who behaved abominably in their personal lives is long and varied. I like Hemingway,   F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Hunter Thompson, too, doesn't mean I do my own writing hopped up on drugs and booze, or that I condone incest. All art attracts a motley crew of sometimes unbalanced characters, and some are more unbalanced than others. But through their flaws, they sometimes find universal truths... for me, that's one of the things Poe's work does. I respect that it doesn't do that for everyone.;Lauren, all good points. I'm reminded of the people who condemn John Lennon for being a misogynist, an alcoholic, a drug abuser, often willfully cruel to those closest to him, and easily taken in to causes he didn't necessarily understand. All perfectly valid criticisms of his behavior. But one can like his work without condoning the darker aspects of what he was capable of, and I don't know how I would have turned out if I'd been asked to choose between my mother and father at age four, lost my only father figure at 14, and then lost my mother at 17. None of those are *excuses* for the times he behaved badly in his adult life, but it is easy to see how parental abandonment played into his tendency to act outrageously.;Again, I never said he was a paragon of virtue - I said that the context in which I was studying his work lead to my finding parallels between the ""hell and damnation"" aspects of what he wrote and the ""hell and damnation"" aspects of what my modern peers believed. You have latched onto one word (earnest) and have concluded that by ""earnest"" I meant *virtuous* in some way. Nothing could be further from the truth. One can be very earnest while advocating an offensive, strident, disrespectful, unnuanced, or amoral point of view. ""Earnest"" is not a synonym for ""honest."" ""Earnest"" means ""with great personal conviction."" A person can earnestly tell you you are going to burn in hell, or   earnestly tell you that one person's life is inherently worth less than another's, or earnestly tell you you were kidnapped by aliens last night and replaced with a pod person. It doesn't make what they say true; ""earnest"" means *they* believe it to be true.Do I think Hawthorne had deep personal convictions that he believed to be true? Yes. Do I *agree* with them? No. Which is one of the reasons I am not excited about delving back into his world.;Scott, no worries. I apologize for our lightheartedness, as it clearly touched a nerve for you; I certainly didn't mean any harm by it, and I don't think anyone else did either. This is a pretty intense course, and some of us deal with the heavy workload by being silly on the boards from time to time. I too find both men to be fascinating *people*, in good ways and bad, and I might like both author's works, had we stopped at, say, three Hawthorne novels/collections. Unfortunately, overexposure, the environment in which I first studied his work, and the fact that the teacher in question was far more in love with Hawthorne the *man* than Hawthorne the *author*, and told us so regularly (and, in my mind, to an inappropriate degree) ruined any ability I might have to *enjoy* as opposed to *appreciate* his work. I still *appreciate* it, in the same sense I do any author... but *enjoyment* isn't something I can find in Hawthorne anymore.At least, I haven't yet. We'll see what a fresh look does for me.;Lazy writing. ;) I kid, of course... in my opinion, you've already answered your own question - it is, indeed, ""prepackaged symbolic baggage and shorthand referential stuff from other books."" But by modern standards, using too many quotations and not enough subtle allusion *is* considered lazy writing, which is why books that employ too much direct quoting feel dated by today's standards.;I very much understand your frustration, but keep in mind, too, that we all have varying levels of proficiency (expertise) in English. So, particularly with regard to grammar and spelling, what looks excellent to one peer might need improvement in the eyes of another peer. I know that if I were evaluating essays in my second or third languages, I would miss many grammar errors; being fluent in a language is not necessarily the same as being fluent enough to correct someone *else's* grammar/spelling in print! It's also entirely possible for one to be very fluent in English but not be very good at spotting grammar/spelling errors... there are plenty of native English speakers who have difficulty with spelling and grammar. Ideally, peers would take an extra few seconds to make their position more clear. For instance, instead of ""Great grammar and spelling,"" one could say: ""English is not my native language, but I can find no errors,"" or ""Grammar is not my strongest area, but this looks good to me,"" or ""Your grammar and spelling is terrific - this is coming from an English teacher!"" (or an English major, or a writer, or ""one who loves to read,"" or whatever might convey that your grasp of grammar is strong).It's just a matter of adding a few extra words to clarify where your *own* abilities are on the scale. I know it's a very short peer review period, but if *many* of us make that little extra effort, perhaps peer feedback will become more useful.Think of it this way - if anonymous' comments, instead of being:""Great use of grammar and spelling"" and""Was terrible and distracting from incorrect use of grammar and spelling""Were:""Not good on grammar and spelling myself, but this looks like great use of grammar and spelling"" and ""Terrible and distracting from incorrect use of grammar and spelling. For example, (wrong word) should be (right word) and (incorrect spelling) should be (correct spelling). You need a comma after (word), and a period after (word).""Then the two comments would not look contradictory at all. One peer thought the grammar and spelling was good, but he/she admits English grammar is not their strong suit. The other peer considers himself/herself more confident in written English, and provides helpful examples for improvement. (The examples may or may not be *correct*, but if examples are provided, the person whose essay is being reviewed can then decide for themselves if Peer #2 actually knows what they are talking about!)I'm not saying those of us who are confident in our English skills are obligated to go through and point out every single tiny error - that would take more time than most of us have within the two day period. But if you're going to criticize grammar, provide at least an example or two. If you are going to leave *no*   criticism for form, and it is perfect in every way, then try to be specific about what you're praising. That way, we can all help each other.The same applies to content grading, by the way. Be specific about what you like and do not like, so that we can learn from each other. If you have specific qualifications (English teacher/student of English/voracious reader/writer) mention them. if you have specific difficulties (non-native English speaker/dyslexic/have a hard time noticing grammar errors etc), mention those. Toss that information in the third box for general comments, if you like... that way you can just copy paste that note into each essay you evaluate. Again, providing that information isn't a matter of ""bragging rights"" or self-deprecation... we are *all* intelligent, attentive students, in Dr. Rabkin's words. But providing that information can provide some valuable *context* for what you have said. Keeping in mind, of course, that just because one claims to be an English teacher or a writer doesn't mean they know what they're talking about, and just because someone is a non-native speaker doesn't mean they *don't* know what they are talking about. All feedback is worth considering, no matter who it comes from. But, particularly if you are going to be especially full of praise or especially critical of an essay, context is useful to have.;LOL. As my parents used to remind me, ""There is a bottom 10% to every graduating class and every profession!"" Also, this is the internet, so just because someone claims qualifications doesn't necessarily mean they have them.And before anyone else mentions it, there are plenty of non-native English speakers whose English is better than most native English speakers.So, my general suggestion is that disclosing any detriments or particular talents is helpful... if English is your second (third, fourth, etc) language, but you know you are very proficient in it, then the fact that you are a non-native speaker is probably not relevant - unless you run across an idiom or other construction which is unfamiliar to you, in which case it may be worth mention"
FALSE,St12,Coh1,5,0,0,3,20.2686,0.148012,1,1,2,0.003913894,0.00729927,"As promised, here is my essay on the topic. It's far from the greatest thing I've ever written... the word count got me on this one. I had to rework my conclusion entirely in order to fit in most of my  points, and it shows. Audience and purpose cost me words, since not  everyone is familiar with ""bloody"" as an oath!Careful study of Dracula unearths compelling rewards for  those who seek them. While Stoker   s portrayal of different accents and  dialects is often incorrect to the point of parody, in chapter 24, an  account that initially appears to be full of amusing Van Helsing  malapropisms also serves a second purpose;   when carefully examined, it  reinforces the importance of blood in the narrative.Van Helsing  recounts the beginning of his conversation with the sailors in broad  terms     Dracula arrives, requests passage, the captain    swear[s] much,     and later, the captain    swear[s] at [Dracula] in many tongues.    Van  Helsing clearly does not feel the need to repeat the exact words used.Quite suddenly, his manner of storytelling shifts, and he  does relate  the exact language:    the captain tell[s] him that he had better be  quick, with blood, for that his ship will leave the place, of blood,  before the turn of the tide, with blood.    We could interpret this as  Stoker providing his readers with some levity; the average Briton  intuitively realizes the captain   s actual words were    bloody quick,""  etcetera, in the sense of the well-known oath.However, the  discerning reader can also interpret the passage as follows: The captain  tells Dracula he had better be quick with his bloody (unclean) package,  for the ship will leave the ""place of blood"" (England, the site of the  attacks), before the turn of the bloody tide     the tide carrying Dracula  is indeed a symbolically bloody one, having been the route he took to  both begin and end his reign of terror. Van Helsing adds,    The captain swear again, polyglot    (further  drawing the distinction between unimportant swearing and important  references to blood), and relates that the captain does not want  Dracula, ""with blood [upon him], in his ship, with blood on her also.   Throughout  this passage, Van Helsing interprets    bloody    in a deliberately literal  sense, unlocking a wealth of symbolism and implying that the captain  does not desire Dracula aboard his ship for fear that granting a vampire  safe passage might stain his soul, or, indeed, the    soul    of the very  ship itself.;I think Lauren's main point is that some of our peers are using the review process as an excuse to be nasty as opposed to helpful. In order for criticism to qualify as *constructive* criticism, one needs to point out something that could be improved *and* something the writer has done well... thus Dr. Rabkin's instructions.There is also a little bit of finesse required in order for the negative aspect of criticism to be helpful. ""Your writing is not academically fit"" or ""This is terrible"" are not *helpful* criticisms, because they don't explain *why*... where, exactly, is it ""not fit?"" What, exactly, is ""terrible?"" The grammar? (cite the mistakes, and give a fix.) The wording? (cite the awkward phrasing, and give a fix.) The lack of thesis? (provide a possible thesis and explain where the essay drifts from the thesis.) Yes, that takes more time than ""Terrible."" ""Good."" ""I liked this."" ""You suck."" But that's what constructive criticism *is*. Note the instructions again, which say: ""An ideal response would note one aspect of Form/Content that the writer does  well and would profit by continuing and one aspect of Form/Content that the  writer would profit by improving in ways you make clear."" (emphasis mine). ""In ways you make clear"" is a vital phrase. No criticism is helpful if you do not make clear exactly what was good and exactly what needed improvement. Saying ""grammar sucked"" or ""usage wrong"" or ""essay not clear"" is simply not helpful. The writer knows that you didn't like it, but they don't know how to fix it, or even if they really did something wrong.And I would strongly suspect that some of the people complaining of ""contradicting feedback"" are themselves guilty of not being specific in the feedback they leave for others.I don't have any professional qualifications with regard to critiquing, I'm just a lifelong writer who's critiqued my peers in classroom settings, in writing circles, and over the internet for many, many years, all in non-anonymous venues. I think it's the anonymity of peer reviews and the short time we have to complete peer reviews that's breeding this brand of laziness in some.Note that throughout this post I have referred to ""some"" peers, not all or many - I have received great, helpful feedback, useless, vague feedback, and specific feedback wherein the reviewer clearly didn't know what they were talking about (such as that semicolons should never be used, only ""dots"" (periods)). I much prefer helpful feedback, and even feedback that is incorrect but honest and polite, to nasty or vague feedback. Since the feedback regarding semicolons was quite polite, for example, I am re-evaluating whether semicolons are appropriate for this audience and purpose. Had that reviewer just said ""bad punctuation!"" I wouldn't have known what bothered them, and had they been rude (""Your sentences are far too long. Dots are the only appropriate thing!"") I would have written them off (and been confused!).;Paul, all good points. I didn't read anyone in this particular thread as being unable to live with peer assessment; for myself, I have accepted it as the way this platform works, and it serves my purposes as a low income person who lives in a country where higher education is significantly more expensive than it is in the UK and EU. (One year of uni cost me $30,000 US, and I could only get half of it covered by scholarships, because few people have those sums lying around, so even affluent students compete for aid... effectively pricing out students such as myself, for whom even $1000 US is a princely sum. Needless to say, I am still paying off that one year of uni 15 years later.) I read Lauren's posts as frustrated, but willing to offer suggestions as to how to peer review in a more useful way. That's the spirit in which I made my post, too. Critiquing is indeed a difficult skill, and I doubt anyone expects all of our peers to be able to do so on a ""professional"" level; this course is not geared toward ""professionals,"" for a start, so that would be an unrealistic expectation to have.By the same token, if we wish to improve the usefulness of peer review feedback, there is no guidance or involvement by the professors regarding how to do so. In previous courses I've taken, when problems with the rubric emerged, the professors adjusted the rubric and clarified expectations. The leaders of this course are content to let us find our own way. That being the case, the only way to improve peer feedback is for those of us who are more experienced to explain where the problems are, and, broadly, how to improve them amongst ourselves. That's not just hollow complaining, in my book - it comes from a genuine desire to help everyone get the most out of the course... even, and perhaps especially, those who are struggling with how to *give* feedback.;"
FALSE,St12,Coh1,6,1,0,3,15.9042,0.188629,2,4,6,0.007556675,0.02,"I had a really difficult time getting my essay together this week. Part of it is because I had to bow out of the Frankenstein essay (life got very crazy all at once, and I found myself both mentally and physically exhausted), and my brain very quickly gets ""out of practice"" at this kind of formal writing. Even when I'm out of practice, though, writing comes very easily to me... I usually glance over my notes, bang out 600-800 words in 20 minutes, and then spend the next few days paring things down and perfecting what I want to say. Revision takes time, but the initial act of getting my thoughts down is almost never a problem.Not so this week! I knew what my topic was, but I couldn't seem to form coherent sentences about it, let alone distill those into a thesis. It's at times like these that I realize what it must be like for people to whom writing doesn't come easily... I can't imagine how they manage, because mere hours of not having my ""writing mojo"" drives me around the bend!With time running out in the wee hours of the morning, my tea going cold, and a busy day ahead of me (effectively eating the last few hours of submission time), I was beginning to panic. Then it hit me... when I come up against these moments of inarticulateness in my creative writing, I put my headphones on and crank up the music... and I hadn't done that in a while. So, I loaded up three albums worth of U2 (Achtung Baby, Zooropa and How To Disassemble an Atomic Bomb, for the curious), turned up the volume, and went to work.Seventy minutes later, done. It's a ridiculous thing to forget after twenty-five years of writing, but the truth is, I always write better with a ""soundtrack.""... and often, when I'm struggling for the right words to put on the page, I do forget that!I once had the fortune to converse, very briefly, with Aaron Sorkin (writer of A Few Good Men, The West Wing, Sports Night, The American President, and Charlie Wilson's War amongst many others). I used my opportunity to ask him the same question in the title of this thread: ""How do you write? The ideas of a fiction writer are ephemeral, but what's your process? When you're sitting down to write something, do you have rituals or need things just so?""Here was his reply:""Story's what I struggle with the most (a handicap if you do what I do for a living.) My parents started taking me to plays when I was very little and lots of times they took me to plays I was too young to understand but I always loved the sound of dialogue and that's what I wanted to imitate when I started writing.          I worship at the alter of intention and obstacle. (Somebody wants something-- something's standing their way of getting it. As Neil Simon says, ""It doesn't matter what the person wants--he wants the girl, he wants the money, he wants to get to Philadelphia, it doesn't matter, he's got to want something."" I'll take it a step further and say that anytime you can substitute the words ""need"" for ""want"" you'll be in even stronger shape. The obstacle has to be formidable and the intention and obstacle will be the drive shaft of your story. Now you can start laying in themes and writing dialogue in your own style. (At the risk of being pretentious I want to recommend a 64 page pamphlet by Aristotle called ""The Poetics"". Basically, he wrote out the rules of what drama is. If I'm writing something and it's come off the rails in mid-draft or something's not working in rehearsal, it's usually because I've broken one of the rules and my job is to figure out which one and how.)       As far as my writing environment, I write in an office on the Warner Bros. lot and I have a small office at home. I play music in my car and hope that something I hear gets something going. I'm very active when I write--jumping up and down from my desk and pacing around and playing all the characters.        Woody Allen doesn't have a desk in his office. He writes on a four-poster bed sitting up on one elbow. Stephen Sondheim writes while lying down on a couch. He writes for 10 minutes and naps for 20 minutes. Stephen King whips off a trilogy in the time it takes me to shave in the morning. Sam Shepard used to drop acid, hop in his pick-up and drive to a cabin the mountains where he'd write True West in a weekend. Write the way you write.          Aaron""  Needless to say, that gracious note of his has survived about three hard drive failures now; I keep it backed up on the same three thumb drives I keep my writing on. (Redundancy is a writer's best friend in a technology driven world.) I was, in fact, reading it over again tonight, searching for where my writing mojo went, when I remembered I needed to put some music on already.So, for anyone still reading... how do you write? What helps you get those essays done... or whatever other writing you have on your plate?;Were I evaluating that essay, I'd be tempted to give it a 1 solely out of pique... I dearly wanted to write an essay on The Cask of Amontillado, as it's been my favorite Poe story since I was very small. If I couldn't use that (and, out of respect for my classmates and their time, I did not!), then they can't use The Masque of the Red Death!(I'm kidding about grading on the basis of pique, of course... but I would be very irritated indeed... and such an essay probably does deserve a 1 on the basis of ""did not follow directions."");I *wanted* to compare the two, but I would in no way have had room to do justice to either... not in 320 words. I am happy with my decision to focus on Poe alone, having now seen five essays that hurriedly summarize Poe and then hurriedly summarize Hawthorne, and end up saying little about either.I'm not saying it can't be done; I'm sure some people did it quite well. But for myself, I would've needed a good 800 words to work with in order to write a compare/contrast essay that was truly insightful. Given that, I chose to be insightful about one author rather than be banal about both.;"

It's a shame; I just gave my first 6 to an essay and was *so* thrilled to do so... and then I get an essay that, while not bad, is going to require me to re-read two stories I haven't read in 15 years in order to review content appropriately. I'm going to have to skim them and be uncharacteristically pithy* in my comments, because I really don't have time to be re-reading more Poe, much as I'd like to. Like everyone else, I've got Wells to tackle.*Said pithiness will not extend to comments I plan to leave regarding the importance of reading the syllabus and following directions. Arrgh.;Patricia, fair point! The Hawthorne section was quite well done, so I may give it a passing grade, albeit grudgingly. I suppose I was thinking about re-reading the unassigned stories because I like to leave thoughtful feedback even when the essay doesn't meet the requirements. In this case, though, since the author of the essay made no effort to follow the syllabus, it's reasonable for me to not put much effort into feedback. I guess I just don't like to appear as though I'm engaging in tit-for-tat, even anonymously, since peer feedback is the only form of feedback available to us in this course.So I wish I could afford to be more generous with feedback, if not the actual grade... but in the interests of time, I'll be taking your advice.;Essays are definitely improving. I gave my first 6 this time around, and was thrilled to do so. It was a truly flawless essay.;I really should be getting to grips with my Wells essay, but I can never resist a Who thread... Indeed, my Doctor is asexual. I can be persuaded to see him as asexual romantic (i.e. not interested in sex, but occasionally forming intense relationships that have romantic undertones)... that's how I interpret his feelings for Rose, and even Sarah Jane Smith. He's capable of forming very deep emotional attachments, he just doesn't want to shag. ;) ;I'm fairly sure that statement is just clarifying that the grading process is peer based. Put another way, it's saying ""Your grade according to a random sample of your peers is ___, but it may have scored higher or lower with a different peer group, or if it had been reviewed by a professor.""It is probably phrased that way for a few different reasons. In addition to clarifying that peer review is subjective, that statement may be pointing to the fact that the professor does have the option of recalibrating the grades or making certain portions of the assignment extra credit after the grading period has ended. Dr. Rabkin has chosen not to take advantage of any of these features, so in this class, the grade we receive is the final grade. In other courses I have taken, there were various avenues to improve your grade, if the professor retroactively decided to ""grade on a curve"" (because no one in the class did well), or to make part of the assignment extra credit (because most of the class forgot the second part), or by submitting your peer reviewed paper directly to the professor for a recheck, etc. All of these things are quite time-intensive for the professor, to my understanding, which may be why Dr. Rabkin opted out. In any case, the answer is that in *this* class, the grade listed is the final grade. In other classes, the grade listed might not be so permanent (usually in the sense that you may have ways to bring that grade up).;Anyone want to discuss ""The Country of the Blind""? As a person with a congenital disability, I found the story fascinating, and it reveals certain truths about the disabled community that remain today, both good and bad. If I write my essay on this one, I think my greatest challenge is going to be how to discuss it without putting it in too much of a modern context - per the instructions to avoid discussing non-literary matters.;@Mussarat, that is a fascinating interpretation. The idea of nature vs. technology hadn't occurred to me because of my own prior knowledge. In modern society and with modern advancements in science, we now understand that blind people, deaf people, and th;I think that is a great interpretation too. To be honest, having never read the story until now (I'm not sure how it escaped my notice for so long!), I was prepared for either a purely allegorical tale, or a moralizing tale about how disability turns people into savages, as the world often seems to fear even to this day. (It is difficult to organize an event purely for people with disabilities, because non-disabled people are for some reason always concerned that we will trash the space and have never learnt how to function in society... and then it is difficult to get disabled people to *attend* such events, as many of them are equally afraid that a large gathering of disabled people cannot politely conduct themselves, or will otherwise be a ""bad influence"".) So, I would not have blamed Wells for taking such an approach, as the strange fears and misconceptions still exist today; but I was gratified that he did not tell quite such a simple story.;Masako, true, and yet in the end, it is the sighted man, Nunez, who dies in the mountains. The Country of the Blind survives.The revised ending portrays the reverse, which raises an entirely new set of questions.;It is a ""pit"" to Nunez. Not so to the inhabitants, who praise its water, land, etc. Your interpretation is completely valid, but I think one of the things Wells is saying in this story is that the value of intangible things (like sight) depend upon who is doing the valuing. What is the value of sight if you live in a place where no one has ever seen, and sight is not necessary to accomplish any task? Nunez's sight *has* no value to the inhabitants. That is why he cannot become their King. What to him is priceless enough to risk his life for, is useless fancy to them. Similarly, the community does not find Medina-sarote beautiful, because she does not feel beautiful to the touch. To Nunez, she is beautiful, because she looks beautiful. The two societies (sighted and blind) value things differently, and those valuations affect how they see the world and each other. Nunez sees the blind as deprived and less than (recall how he can't bring himself to strike a blind man, insinuating that to do so would be morally inappropriate because the blind are at a disadvantage - a misconception he then finds to be untrue). The blind see *Nunez* as ignorant (""newly formed"") and less than, because he is bad at living as they do. There is no real ""right side"" or ""wrong side"" to this story, in my view. It is fundamentally about two societies who have completely different experiences of what the world *is*... and what happens when those two societies come together.Just food for thought... I can only walk a few steps, and that is all I have ever been able to walk. I have never run, and will never run. I feel no desire to ever do so, because I can travel faster than the average runner in my wheelchair, anyway. Thus, I don't consider myself ""deprived"" of anything. Ablebodied society does, though, and because ablebodied society *assumes* that I am deprived and unable, I have often found myself deprived of *opportunities*, on the mistaken belief that I am unable to avail myself of them. So, did the deprivation come about because I am disabled, or because other people make assumptions about what my disability means to *them*? Most ablebodied people would say that that deprivation is caused by my disability. I would argue that the deprivation in fact comes from erroneous *assumptions* about what I can and cannot do. In an accessible environment, or with a little time to devise my own accessibility modifications, I am often *more able* than most ablebodied people. To *me*, disability is not the problem, assumptions and prejudice are. To ablebodied people, their assumptions and/or prejudices aren't the problem, the problem is that I had the temerity to be disabled in the first place.Neither view is empirically wrong or right; it all depends on one's point of view.;I understand what you were saying. No worries, I am a fan of civilized discussions, and this is one of those. :) I agree that robbing Nunez of his sight was not the right choice. That, to me, was one of the most interesting parts of the story, because I see a similar attitude in disabled communities today. At gatherings of disabled people, I am considered ""not *really* disabled"" because I can stand and walk a few steps. I have been disabled all my life, and do a lot of advocacy work on behalf of all kinds of disabilities, so that attitude is both amusing and irritating... but the fact remains, many people consider me ""not one of them"" because I can bear weight for short periods. Of course, the ablebodied world doesn't consider me one of them, either, so I often have one foot in both worlds. It's not a bad way to live one's life, and for me, it has worked well... but it does occasionally make me feel like I don't ""belong"" in either world.So to me, the scene where they decide to remove Nunez's eyes had a special resonance, because the disabled community as a whole still does suffer from this idea that only when we all have exactly the same disability can we work together for equality! This attitude is exactly why the disability rights movement in my country (USA) has stalled. We spend all of our time arguing about whose needs are ""more important"" or who gets to be ""first"", and end up accomplishing little for anyone.But that is, of course, a very modern interpretation of the story, and thus, such an interpretation is outside the scope of this course.;Thanks, Sean, I'll check that out!Hmm, I can see the religious perspective. Starting to wonder if I should go within a million miles of this story for my essay, as I'm afraid I might get penalized for interpreting it ""too literally""!;I'm still debating... I've got what I want to do blocked out, and it won't by any means be an exhaustive traipse through the history of disability rights/culture (because I've no room for that, it's off topic, and I'm not terribly inclined to do so). My hesitation comes mainly from the fact that this course *is* subtitled ""...our modern world,"" and I'm probably one of few in the class who brings this particular lens to the discussion, so it could, if written well, certainly enrich the reading for some/most, if handled through a modern lens *but also* from a literary perspective. I'm reminded of the essay I saw on the Hawthorne/Poe thread about ""Refrigerator Women,"" a concept that had not yet formed as a crystallized, titular literary phenomenon in Hawthorne and Poe's day, but which certainly applies. That, to me, is an example of a valid way to apply a modern concept in a relevant way, and I think I can follow that path.However, if I do go that route, I run the risk of peer reviewers thinking I willfully omitted or was blind (no pun intended) to the standard literary metaphors that blindness brings up... and that's not so, of course. It's just that that sort of thing has been done and done again, and this particular story said something different to me. With the revised ending (rocks fall, everyone dies... except the heroic sighted man, of course), the symbolism would have leapt at me first. With the original ending, and knowing that Wells had a penchant for using his writings to muse about how societies function (and fall into dysfunction), I see very different messages - not all of them good, but all fundamentally more interesting and more rarely encountered.You're correct, I've got plenty of room to hang a potential albatross around my neck on this one, but I like your idea of writing two and posting my preferred take on the forums, too. I think that's going to come down to time, so I'll see what happens.;(Warning, this may be outside the scope of this conversation - it is certainly outside the scope of the story!)I'm finding the discussion of proprioception vs. vision interesting because, due to my congenital disability, my experience is *entirely* different! I didn't even catch the error, because although both my proprioception and my vision are fine, my ability to walk depends on proprioception *and* vision *and* something else I've never been able to pinpoint... and, in fact, scientists are still trying to determine what that third something is via medical studies. Briefly, if I look down at my feet when walking, I will fall (immediately, straight to the ground). This former mystery has been solved due to research on the elderly; as one's balance decreases with age, vision becomes more important to compensate for balance (because visual input tells you how close you are to upright). Elderly people who look at their feet as they walk suffer more falls because their brain does not have enough visual input to tell which way is up!If someone crosses my path while I'm walking, I'll fall (again, the effect is immediate). If I plan to walk from point A to point B, and someone is standing in my path, my body freezes up and I cannot take a step - even if I can see that I have room to go around them. Because these issues have nothing to do with proprioception or vision, this is what scientists are still trying to figure out... what about that particular form of visual input causes the brain to short out the motor functions, even when the person can see that the person will only temporarily be in the way, or that there is room to go around? This happens to people with very specific medical conditions - multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's, cerebral palsy (what I have) and some, but not all, stroke patients. The conditions share some common clinical signs, but each is a very different form of injury/malfunction in the brain... so modern medicine is still trying to figure out what's going on.;I find it somewhat amusing that in previous weeks, my reviewers all said things like ""I would have liked to see more about ____, but I appreciate we're all working with a tight word limit."" And this week, my reviewers all said, ""This would have been better if you had contrasted it with (between two and four additional works)."" Well, yes, of course it would have, if I had had the space to do so....;"

In the only other Coursera course I have taken, the students were given credit for the peer assessments they did, but the grades were not counted toward any official grade for the course. The peer assessments were used for feedback only, and often valuable, but in many cases, not so much. I tried to read about the peer assessments in this course, but it is rather confusing. Are the grades given by peers counted as part of our overall, official grade, or are we just given credit for doing them? If the former is the process for this course, I will not participate in the essays. As an educator myself who uses peer evaluations in my own classes, I would never allow the grades given by other students to be the official grade or part of the official grade at the end of a class. The answer to this question will determine whether or not I participate fully in this course, so a timely answer would be greatly appreciated!;Lol, this thread made me laugh.

And since this thread was started, I've been thinking of that old Multiplication Rocks song.....Three is a magic number  Ya it is, it's a magic number  Somewhere in that ancient mystic trinity  You'll get three  As a magic number  The past, the present, the future,  Faith, and hope, and charity,  The heart, the brain, the body,  Will give you three,  It's a magic number  It takes three legs to make a tripod or to make a table stand,  And it takes three wheels to make a vehicle called a tricycle  And every triangle has three corners,  Every triangle has three sides,  No more, no less,  You don't have to guess  That it's three  Can't you see?  It's a magic number  A man and a woman had a little baby  Yeah they did  And there were three in the family  And that's a magic number  3, 6, 9,  12, 15, 18,  21, 24, 27,  30   etc.;I think the lesson is.....it's Hans' business, not ours.

If he makes decisions that we don't agree with, they are his decisions, and at least he's doing something.  ;There ya go.   I'm just glad I don't get paid in gold as big as my head.   No one at Walmart would know how to make change.;I think it's weird to be reading these traditional stories on a computer anyway.   I think I have downloaded 3 different versions of everything lol.   I have 3 different ebook apps on my laptop, and then i download them to my phone as well.   I find it pretty easy to squeeze in some reading on my phone when I'm in waiting rooms, long cashier lines, etc.   I decided to take the course just to see if I could get through it lol.

But if anyone wants to skip the first one, I would submit a paper ANYWAY, just so you would know what is required to submit it.   ;I read a story about a fishwife when I was in first grade--and I instantly nicknamed my sister ""fishwife"".   My mother would yell at me about it.   Then when my sister was about 20, I heard my mom call her ""fishwife"".   My take on these stories is more about the character of the fisherman's wife.   She never seems to change.   She is always bossy, and can't be pleased.   I think that these stories were told to amuse people because we all know someone like that.   They may have been told in the hopes that these people would change, but in my opinion, they never do.   (Sorry, Sis.);I think I want to be pope now.;Ehhhh, we just know we deserve the best.

I'm going to throw this out there, and I may get some people disagreeing....BUT I think that none of us has been exposed to much until the past, oh, 20 years.   Between 24 hour news, and the internet, we are beginning to get a glimpse of the world.   Think about how many new ideas you have probably been exposed to....(and I'm sorry, if you can't at least point to ""2 girls, one cup"", or some other bizarre video, then you aren't being honest with yourself!)......The only way the world is going to change is with time, information, and education.   It's easy to disregard things you don't know about or understand.   These stories--they are information for you to use--to know that there are people who have these views, it's something to think about, how can we help people to feel differently about these things?....;lol I feel nervous about mine.

Well, not so much things as 'Books and authors' -- though other favorites can certainly be included!My favorite authors are PC Hodgell and Michelle Sagara West.My favorite book outside of theirs is Pamela Dean's Tam Lin - which often encourages me to go back to school in hopes of finding the Wild Hunt.Carrie;Thanks!

Thank you so much for the tip, Byurakn!;Those tales do  not only reflect the society and the time during which they were written, but they also had a huge impact on people's life.  I imagine how this way of looking at  life  highly encouraged marrying  your very first love... Or more dramatic... Made girls easily accept to marry the first man who asked for  their hand.Stories are very powerful vectors of ideas. They can highly influence a whole generation. They can be used in many different ways. I tend to comment the stories I read to my kids and ask them questions to help them think critically about the story. I prefer stories which will empower my children.Traditional tales  including princesses and dragons  are highly interesting and part of our culture... But... ""How to train a dragon"" reflects today's ideals. I read so so so many times all my fairy books when I was a kid, and I had plenty of very traditional ones in original versions... They had a huge influence on me. Maybe not always a good one, because I did not live in the same world anymore... And, being able to think about them critically came later I believe. But I have to say that they did nourish my imagination from a very young age. Little Red Cap from the Grimm was inspired from  Little Red Ridding Hood  first written by Charles Perrault. But, Charles Perrault did not invent that story which  used to be told in families the evening near the fire. It evolved sort of in a darwinian way... slowly from old myths... Most stories tell how to survive in the world...  (Don't follow strangers...) Stories can save.  Stories can cure, Stories can do so many things, really...    When you tell a story... Be aware of its power... Make good use of it...;I didn't read the Six Soldiers of Fortune as a model of teamwork, more of how the soldiers were greedy and deceitful. I'm going to have to go back and read this one again to see if I can find the optimism in the character's actions. :-) Thanks!;I think the reason the story doesn't portray the soldiers as greedy is hidden in the beginning of the story: these soldiers fought for a king, but the king did not reward them afterwards as he should have.For a contemporary parallel in the US, see the current backlog of VA claims for veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan.   You could imagine retelling the story with a brigade of veterans storming Washington and carrying off medical supplies or something.;This is an ongoing problem for me as I teach successive on-line courses, i.e., forgetting where all the dates are and resetting them for the next class.   I'm sure the staff that monitor the forums will get the dates updated soon (and only wish I had administrative assistants who would do the same for me.);Not only step-mothers as I noticed.The fathers are usually good, wise and thoughtfull (I'm right after the story about The Straw, The Bean and The Coal).Mothers like in ""Hansel and Grethel"", ""The Three Spinsters or ""The Raven"" are always the bad ones.  Not only mothers but women in overall too like in ""The Fisherman and his Wife"" and put in the bad light like in ""Clever Grethel"". Evil witches...Where are the bad men? One example is the King in the story of soldiers, other the The Wonderful Musician. The second still concerns me, why the Musician was not punished.PS. I apologise for spelling mistakes if any in the stories' titles.;Although I do not agree with everything you said, the first point you made regarding the causes are exactly what i was going for. The thought that the kings had a right to rule is a given, because if you think about it, when someone is rich and has everything handed out to him/her just because he/or she was born to someone already with power, then that can only mean that that person is in fact lucky, from birth. On the other hand, that would mean that people who weren't lucky to be born like that would have to accomplish great deeds in order to change their status (because being born again into a different family and strata is not an option).That being said, I cannot agree when you say that people of low birth have their skills taught o them. So far, from what I have read, it seems those people already have those skills and they just never noticed or actually used them to their advantage. Take the story of the little tailor who killed seven flies with one strike for example; one cannot assume he only found out he had all that cunning in him by killing a bunch of flies, that was just the motto for the story to start, an excuse for him to have something to brag and make himself noticed.;Hmmm. Is there a history of matriarchy in Northern Europe? I don't remember learning that (though it's entirely possible that I am simply unaware....).;Hi Byurakn, Yes, I hadn't noticed that. You are right, the simplicity is part of it. The way they portray the human, is devoid of complexity, too. I just finished reading a very modern novel, Little Brother, and comparing the two works, I can definitely see this. And also conflicts are resolved withing fairy tales without much dwelling. Like in that horrifying faithful John, the horrific decision the king makes at the end about his children, is made in a line. It makes me think of the contemporary debate on free will. As much as some of the tales are morality tales, the way they are presented sides with the system view of free will, that each person, the system that he is, behaves and decides in a certain way, not much dwelling. Cinderella is kind and obedient by nature. She doesn't dwell on whether or not to confront the stepmother. If some character shows a change, it's due to seeing the result of what he has done, like in the raven. Then his system changes to another one.  Very illuminating thought,Thanks;"

I find contextualising a piece of literature by learning about the era and part of the world it was written in incredibly enlightening to my reading. Often I will read first and then research afterwards, as others have said, it's a good idea to get your own perspective first, even if that perspective is all over the place at least your head is filled with ideas which are placed there by the literature itself as opposed to other sources. I like to read other sources which are not directly linked to the novel or story itself (for example for the Grimm Tales I just googled nineteenth century Germany, looked for a decent enough webpage, and I'm now faced with a wealth of information which is allowing me to further develop my ideas and I can go back to the Grimm text with new insight into my original points).;Hoi Byurakn,Niet Groningen, maar wel...

Actually, it was the first book ever that I read in English.Currently reading The Portable Poe (yeah, I'm a bit ahead of time because I'm sure 5 days are not enough for me to finish a book).;I started to love reading even before I knew the alphabet. As a child, somehow I was convinced that as soon as I learn the alphabet I will start reading. I was wrong because I started reading even before I knew the alphabet! My school was going in a slow pace (one or two letters a week and my language has 39 letters), so learned rest of the letters by myself and picked up a book. That's how it started. Then my grandmother had to provide me with books, so for a long time I mostly read what she liked, unless she wasn't around and I picked random books from my mother's bookshelf.;I'm sure all the tales have a certain meaning. We're just not there yet to understand them. It's good that you pointed out Fred and Kate and Clever Else because I wanted to open a separate topic about these two stories to discuss them from a cultural point of view.The thing is that we have similar tales in Armenian culture but the messages are much simpler or I'd rather say they are constructed in a way that you totally understand what they're talking about. In the one that is equivalent to Clever Else, a father sends his eldest daughter to bring water from the spring. She goes there, notices a tall tree and starts to think that if she gets married, she will have a son, he will climb the tree, then fall from it and die. And she starts crying. Then the second daughter is sent to the spring. The eldest daughter tells her the story, they start crying together. The youngest one and then their mother is sent. They all sit there and cry. Finally the father goes there and after having learned the story he suggests to stop crying and to have the funeral of the child and carry on.In my culture it's a common practice to start worrying about something that hasn't even happened yet or that you haven't tried it out. I think it is very well shown in the tale and a solution is provided. The tale suggests get rid of non-existing worries by burying it.As for Clever Else, the plot is similar but the message doesn't seem to be the same because it's not focused on Else's worries, it's rather pointing out how ""clever"" she is. I think there is some kind of irony in it. Also, I don't understand the second part of the story about Else's laziness. Does the tale have a message against quick marriages? Is it making fun of female mind, showing that a female cannot be clever? These are my suggestions but I might be wrong.;Javier, I don't know. :) But my guess is that if ""the boy is already dead"", then cutting down the tree won't help, a funeral is a better idea.;karishma, I know it's strange but it's also what Else worries about. By the way, while posting this comment I came up with an idea. If we have a look at Germans, in general they like planning their lives well ahead. Sometimes it's so extreme that someone who has just started their professional career, starts making plans for retirement. Maybe that's what's reflected in Clever Else and that's why she's actually considered as ""clever.""Ah, about my name. Well, it's not a very common one in my country either.

I thought maybe it was because of grief or because he was younger than Elizabeth and Victor anyways, so a teenager might as well be a child for them or maybe he was still in his early teens. But as soon as I reached the part where the monster told the story how   he killed William, I became terribly puzzled, as William's words about his papa sounded like a four-year-old's. Also, the other thing I know is that William can't be younger than six years, if he was born shortly before Victor left Geneva. So approximately how old was William when he died? Have I missed something or Shelley herself didn't give him a proper age?  ;oh, I reread that part. it turns out that Ernest was sixteen, not Wiliam. so confusing. is it me or the book didn't tell what happened to Ernest?;As I was traveling last week, I managed to submit my essay just an hour before my flight but I couldn't grade any essays, as I didn't have internet while I was traveling.

Actually, Victor keeps complaining about how miserable he is because all of his loved ones are dead. He has nobody else left on earth, so he's lonely but hold on... doesn't he do the same to the creature? Doesn't he deprive him of possible happiness with a companion?

So I think it's a good exercise to try to say something important in just 320 words.  ;Thanks for telling, it's on my watchlist :)  ;I don't know about this course but the one I took before (statistics making sense) had about 45 000 participants. But I don't know how many of them managed to earn statement of accomplishment.;I am also happy with the course. Of course, it takes much time and from next week I might even fall behind the schedule, since I started reading the books in advance and the course is going faster than I do. Still, I think it's worth the time. And I absolutely love reading other participants' essays and discussion forums. It is also a great new experience for me, since I haven't done any literature courses before.  ;I think I'm also an addict but since I'm also a perfectionist, I cannot take more than one course at a time, so I keep adding courses to my watchlist, to make sure I always have that one course to follow.The only online course I have had so far is statistics making sense and it was great. After having struggled with statistics for so many years it really started making sense to me. Moreover, I enjoyed the whole process of learning. So if there is anyone who is struggling to understand statistics, I recommend this course.;Somehow this birthmark looks like a mark left after slap. Could it symbolize a slap on the face that was there to prevent the existence of perfect beauty?  ;I've read Bradbury many years ago but it didn't really get me into Sci-Fi. Now that I'm reading Wells for the next unit, I'm totally thrilled. I think I should read more Sci-Fi. I love it!;Yes, I will definitely try Bradbury again. Well, I have to for this course.Orwell's 1984 is on my to read list but I never get there. I've read Jules Vernes as a kid and I also found Journey to the Center of the Earth pretty slow and boring.;So far I've only read The Island of Dr. Moreau  by Wells and I'm currently reading The Invisible Man  and I'm really-really loving it.  From Bradbury I've read Farenheit 451 Degrees,  which was ok, I didn't hate it and  Dandelion Wine, which I loved but according to my understanding of SciFi, it is not SciFi, and also the Martian Chronicles  which I really hated but it was very-very long ago, so I might change my mind in this course.;I love this topic!I have different writing patterns for different fields. For this course, I come up with a thesis well before starting the actual writing process. Then I start thinking and thinking of examples, of sentences and ideas I would like to use in my essay. When the thinking process is done (it's usually by Sunday or Monday afternoon), I start writing the first draft always watching for the word limit. Then I leave it like that and revise my essay just few hours before the deadline on Tuesday. Well, I know that I'm not making too much effort and my theses are always something obvious, though I like going deep for finding examples.I'm currently writing my MSc thesis, which is much tougher. I just come up with thoughts and write it down here and there. I have no idea how I am going to join them together in the end.But then there is creative writing, which I absolutely love doing and I do it in my native language most of the time. That's when writing comes to me very easily. People don't believe me that I can write a 2000 word short story in just 40 minutes. Of course, then I need to spend many hours editing it and making it look the way I want to (which never happens). The same goes for my blog posts. If I have half an hour and I don't know what to do, I just write a 1000-2000 blog post about anything I can think of.;Same here. This is the first time that I haven't given a 1 to anyone. Four 4's and one 5 so far but I might go on and review some more essays. I love this process!;Anonymous, even if someone doesn't explicitly tell that he or she is not a native speaker, it's very easy to see. I'm not a native speaker myself but I always spot the non-native speakers. However, I think someone should not be marked down for mentioning that he or she is not a native speaker. I imagine he or she has received many harsh comments before or even low grades for not writing in perfect English.  ;Someone mentioned a story that wasn't on the syllabus in their essay but I didn't pay much attention to it because the author said that The Birthmark, Rappaccini's Daughter and that story have a common theme. So it was ok, I could still understand what they were talking about. I didn't mark down for it.;I had something discussing the genre of short stories in general and briefly mentioning Poe and Hawthorne. There was nothing about the required reading and the form wasn't quite ok either because it was less than 270 words. In fact, if you cut out all the irrelevant sentences, probably only 200 words would be left. So I tried to be nice but I gave 1 for both form and content. I hope I haven't done anything wrong.;Georgy, is this the one you're talking about?  http://www.planetaskazok.ru/bajovp/kamennyjcvetokbajov;"

Last week I received a comment that I shouldn't have compared Frankenstein and God, the monster and Adam, that I was totally biased and so on but actually the professor also talks about it.  Anyway, I also don't watch the videos before grading simply because there is not enough time. It's already time to write an essay for the 6th unit but I haven't finished watching the Frankenstein videos yet (not to talk about Hawthorne and Poe). But when it comes to grading, I actually try to understand what the author of the essay says and how he or she says it. Someone could have completely missed the point but if the arguments are good enough, I have no reason for marking down.;It should be fine. Even if your grading was not accepted, you will receive a grade for your essay. I had it in the second week when I was traveling and had no internet access to review any essays. I received a grade like in any other week.;Oh, actually the idea of quiz also came to my mind after thinking that some of the reviewers actually don't read the material.;So far, I've never titled my essays (just to save some space for the word count) but this week I got a suggestion to have a title (though I wasn't marked down for it). What do you think?;Oh, that's a great idea and saves space.  ;Oh, in my culture we do start lunch with a main course.  ;Do you think Wells is making fun of religion in the passage with the Sayer of the Law? It seems to me that the passage is a parody of a religious service.  ;Good to know. I was afraid of misinterpreting it.;Oh, great. Actually I was thinking of making the grotesque society (and grotesque religious group as part of it) and how it changes with a new leader as my essay topic but somehow I feared that I might have misunderstood the book.  ;Actually I saw some elements of racism as well.  ""With him it was chiefly the brain that needed moulding; much had to be added, much changed. I thought him a fair specimen of the negroid type when I had finished him..."";Let's use this thread to discuss the scientific errors we find in this week's material. Of course, there are things that were not discovered yet in the end of 19th century but I think it will be fun to find out what he got wrong by then.For example, in  The Island of Doctor Moreau, Dr. Moreau discusses the issue of making animals talk and he succeeds by just operating their vocal organs. However, nowadays it is clear that the reason of animals not talking is not just about the anatomical structure of their mouth and throat but also it is about brain structure (animals don't have Broca's and Wernicke's areas).Also, in  The Invisible Man Griffin says that he couldn't go down the stairs because he couldn't see his feet. It would be true if, besides being invisible, Griffin lost his proprioception for some reason.  Any other examples?;I think you're right. Do you remember that famous test touching your nose with your index finger with your eyes closed? Every healthy individual can do it. And even if you can't quite walk down the stairs in darkness, it's not because you can't see your feet but because you can't see the stairs.  ;The question is not about animals being able to have language or language like signaling system. The question is about human language. You can never operate an animal in a way to make them able to learn the human language. It's not about vocal tract, it's about brain. It's something Wells didn't know by that time.;"

It is helpful to know the historical facts for the setting of a story, but not necessarily the Author's mindset or critical reviews of the piece.   As a reader, I have the knowledge of my own learning and experiences to affect the reading.   A younger reader with less education and experience will not read it the same way and is likely to miss many themes the author included.   Likewise, another person from another lifestyle or country will likely make different connections than I when reading that very same passage.   With or without research, everyone's experience will be their own and unique.What is the best method for this course?   Unless the instructor says otherwise, I'm going with ""It's up to the individual.""

You may see social mobility based on skill and courage in working men and beauty and sweetness in working women, but the women in that group have to be sweet and beautiful while suffering, where the men have to be brave and clever. Sometimes princesses have to be chucked out of the castle to prove how sweet and beautiful they are while suffering. But, by and large, it's all about the high status men being already entitled to their luck and the low status men having to earn it. It's very socially conservative.I think it's a cracking thesis.;Fabio, I hate to be the bearer of negative counter points, but I can think of another one besides ""The Frog Prince"". In the story ""The Knapsack, The Hat, and The Horn"" the main protagonist is a very poor boy who becomes successful through the luck of him finding a magical table cloth. His luck continues as he continues to find powerful magical items that he is able to steal, and use to eventually become king. I could be wrong, so do correct me if I am.;Byurakn, I think you're onto something... If one of them hadn't been there, the whole thing would have fallen apart. And yes, Sydney, that is one of the exceptions I was referring to.Fabio, that's a valid point right there. Although, I DID assume he found out about his skill by killing a bunch of flies. Perhaps I should re-read that. Thanks.That being said, I would like to point out that I was taking all of fantasy into account, not just the Grimms. Uhmmm... Let me get back from the office and I'll illustrate a few examples on this.... but if this is intended for your thesis (and that should cover just the Grimms) then perhaps I'm overreaching. ;There's definitely snobbery and social discrimination in the tales.   When there's a King's daughter's hand in marriage up for grabs and the challenge is met by a 'lucky' poor person, the King or his daughter always go back on their word and it's only by continuing to meet extra challenges set for them that the King or his daughter seem to give up and allow the peasant into their social class.;Oh, good! :);Oooh - Peggie, that's great!I don't know about German history, but I do know that the Vikings had a concept of hamingja  which was a part of the self connected with luck which could   be passed on to descendants and even loaned out. It seems the Norse viewed the self as a sort of gestalt entity comprised of various components that could be detached at will. The Saxons seem to have viewed the web of Wyrd  as the unfolding of fate, which had strings which could be tugged on to alter your luck - as long as you were exceptionally careful about it.;I think your thesis more or less applies to both genders.;I guess it's optional. I wouldn't share the final draft, but the idea, if you are in doubt.  ;I love the idea of your thesis, and I agree with others about the viewpoint at the time of the creation of the stories with nobility being considered to rule by divine right and perhaps continuing the round of luck they had beginning at birth to be born into their class. To that point, from the view point of the story tellers, who were probably all lower class, nobles were the lucky ones never having to work for anything while the commoners had to work to accomplish anything in their lives. It strikes me as a simple fact of existence for them and a lesson to the youngsters telling them they'll have to work for everything.;"

The hare is in some places associated with the moon and the moon is also linked to agrary cicles.  ;Hi, Here is my assignment:The Grimm Brothers' Fairy tale    THE WOLF AND THE SEVEN GOSLINGS    makes evident the semantic proximity of the symbols which represent the mother and the symbols which represent the death. When the goose mother departs to find food for her children, she advices they about the perils of death represented by the Wolf. In her advice the wolf can be recognized by the hoarse voice and the black paws. While the hoarse voice is an extension of the nibbling symbolism through the mouth image, the black paws integrate both the aggressive animal symbolism and the night/darkness symbolism. In according to the french anthropologist Gibert Durand animal and dark symbols might be understanding as the faces of death when negatively valued. The same kind of symbols when it   s euphemized and positively valued can represent the mother. For example, when the night brings a sensorial realism which induces comfort and when the action of biting become to swallow without hurting but protecting.   So when the wolf tries to disguise himself as the goose mother, the horrible aspects of his animalism and his darkness are precisely the elements which reveal him. But when he can disguise these specific aspects he can trick the little gooses and, not incidentally, he look likes their mother.On the other hand, it   s just because the death symbols are symmetric to mother/birth symbols and also because the digestive stomach is symbolically confused with the sexual belly and so with the womb which generates and protect the life that the mother goose can rescue her children of the wolf stomach.   The wolf who swallows the gooses seems to be pregnant of they and the goose mother can bring her children from the death to the life in a new birth .  Thank you for your comments.;"

Laura, I am not a native English speaker, so I really appreciate your generosity in correcting my poor grammar.   Martha, in his book Antropological Structures of the Imaginary, Gilbert Durand (2012) talks about the semantic proximity of the sexual belly and the digestive stomach in a very interesting way, however, he points Freud has noticed this proximity before.   Laura, I did not talk about the clock, but I think you are right; it is a very import symbol in this context. When Gilbert Durand talks about faces of death it is always associated with faces of time. Time symbols can be seen as death symbols, but when they are positively valued, they can announce progress, salvation and even victory over the death through life cycle.

However, I   m not sure if I can help you in anything, as my writing knowledge in English if far below yours.   Anyway, the initiative is great. If I can help in any way, please count on me.

All your ideas do not have to take off every time, but the possibility has to always be there.   When an idea hits it hits big generating far more value than your long string of small wins and losses.    Fortunately there is a new book, Berger   s Contagious on what qualities are needed for an idea to takeoff.   This book proposes six key concepts which can lead to an idea taking off, which are summarized in the acronym STEPPS:           S     Sociality Currency         T     Triggers           E     Emotion           P     Public           P     Practical Value           S -- Stories    This analysis is very encouraging because the elements fit the type of work we are proposing very well.     Here are some key points on how we can use each of the six STEPPS:       1.           S     Sociality Currency:   We need to make our ideas something people will want to tell their friends.        2.           T     Triggers:   This is about making the idea something that immediately brings positive images to the mind.   What we are proposing are believable space exploration adventures that most people can identify with.          3.           E     Emotion:   This is about the idea directly bringing up positive emotions.   The awe of space and the call of adventure are powerful emotions we will rely on.        4.           P     Public:   This is about people accepting the idea as part of their public persona and not just their inner self.   Most people feel it is Ok to be for Space.   The percentage is through the roof for technical people.        5.           P     Practical Value:   This is about seeing the idea as positive and good for society.   Apollo to the Moon was on most lists of the best thing in 20th century.   There is every reason to think that we can make a major space exploration adventure one of the best things in 21st century.        6.           S     Stories:   This is about communicating with people in a way that they enjoy relating too.   This is what our test project is all about.   The trick then is to turn these abstract concepts into direct action and stories that we can test in the market place.   It is all about Do.

Fortunately there is a 21st century way to address the problems and writing fits right in.  The 21st century approach to getting things done is to have a very large number of people in action on a problem nearly continuously.     This applies to writing as much as to all the problem solving examples you have seen on TED.    The action happens when individuals or teams come up with an idea and form a plan.   They then take action that tests the idea in some way.   The results of the test teach us something new and the process starts all over again with new planning based on new information.  This approach is a refinement of standard practices that thousands of people have been using for some time.   The change for the 21st century is to now have tens of thousands of people in such action and then to grow that number using modern communication technologies first to millions and then to billions.   We can and will thereby address the great problems of the 21st century.  Most of the projects are small, intentionally so, like writing a short story for example.   Each project puts only as many resources at risk as the originator feels comfortable with.   To play for the long-haul you cannot risk everything on every play.  Most of the projects fail and that is OK.   The primary purpose of most of the projects are just to teach you something so that you can do better next time.   It is OK to fail fast if you can survive the loose and come back with new ideas just as fast.  Above all the emphasis is on Do, which for us here means write!

I have been stopped for months by the need to get permission to publish from the place I work.   I work at a major R&D laboratory (which shall remain nameless) and they have a right to approve anything I publish.   They care a lot about technical publications because the quality of the publications of their people effects their brand value greatly.     A number of us however also publish Sci-Fi fiction.   They do not care as long as their name does not appear in the publication but they still insist on a complex approval process.   This process should take 4 weeks, but because they do not really care about Sci-Fi at all, this one has now dragged out to 14 weeks.

This means that you do not have a bunch of projects hanging around unfinished.   If they are not going anywhere, you declare them dead, lean what you can, and move on to other actions.    We allowed 6 weeks in our plan for this approval, It took 14 weeks.   Such an unplanned delay is more than enough to kill at    Fail Fast Project   .       Fortunately we can start a new project on the ashes of an old one just as fast as we can kill dead wood.   So that is what I must do now.   For the next couple weeks I will be running down the now dispersed Volume 01 team and coming up with a new plan.      The new plan might look a lot like the old one or be quite different.

This process leaves a large number of misread   characters in the text.This is a tedious process for one person to do for a whole book but it is not so difficult for 40 people to do 10 pages each.   The process requires an editable copy, usually in MicroSoft Word, and a photo copy, usually in Adobie .pdf.   Gutenberg may let volunteers do this.In my last class, one of the profs did this for a paper by Einstein which was seen as a major contribution. There he had the much harder task of correcting a translation from the German of major physics concepts.   What I propose is much easier.;In    Little Brother   , Doctorow makes a political error early in his story and never recovers.   He echoes the strife of the 60   s in scenes and locations, but he has learned nothing from it.   (I was there in those mean streets. The lessons were hard and they still control much of what is happening today.)     Sci-FI over Split over    Nam:    Then the country was then split over the Viet Nam War and the science fiction world split along with the country.   Stories were either Progressive and anti-war, or Conservative and justifying it.    Our reading,    The Martian Chronicles    is a good example of the very conservative stories.   It is Middle America transplanted to Mars without technical explanation.   The very conservative Heinlein also hated that another of his stories,    Stranger in a Strange Land    was adopted by the hippies (left) but that is another story.    The best of the progressive stories grew into    Star Trek, The Next Generation   .   The best of the conservative stories grew into    Star Wars   .     Major lessons were learned, but different people learned very different lessons and many people learned nothing at all.   The major lesson that Doctorow failed to learn is:   When an argument starts, the group that controls the Frame of Reference has already won!    Frame of Reference:    Human beings cannot hold the total universe in their minds.   To operate in society what we do is hold subsets of reality in our minds called    Frames of Reference   .   Each person may hold many Frames, (parent, child, worker, or technical specialist) and can switch between them in a few microseconds.    The political identities are Frames in this since.     They are by necessity incomplete and all Frames cherry pick the facts that support them.   This Frames analysis was developed by the extreme left (Ref. 1) but was used most effectively by the extreme right.    President Ronald Regan was a master of Framing.   His    Welfare Queen    Frame contained very little truth but brilliantly reinforced the Conservative Frame.     President Regan was known as the    Great Communicator    but it would be more true to the history of his time to call him the    Great Framer   .    Today in a debate, such as abortion, if one Frame talks about    service providers    and another frame about    Baby Killers   , then whichever group controls the frame of the debate on day one has already won.   This is why no true debates are now ever carried on.    Broken Plot Line:    Two different frames related to counteracting terrorism are available,    War on Terror    and    Policing   .       About  _ of the way through the story, the author has a surprise second 9/11 level terrorist event which defines the frame for the rest for the story.   This event is so large that only an organized terrorist group could have pulled it off.   This allows the authorities to operate in the    War on Terror    Frame with confidence that the majority of the American people will back them up.   It then does not matter how extreme their actions.    From then on, no matter why the protagonist does what he does, under the War on Terror Frame he will be seen by a majority to be in cahoots with a foreign enemy.   The author has already lost his argument!    Just last week, President Obama week gave a major speech starting the process of converting the official frame for dealing with terrorism from    War on Terror    to    Policing   .     This is a major change but has not yet been widely appreciated.    Alternative Plot Line:    Had the author made the terrorist incident smaller, say a couple of yahoos with pressure cooker bombs, then the American people would be likely to see limiting of the authorizes to the Policing Frame as the correct response.   The protagonist could then be presented as a protector of personal liberties.   Then the War on Terror response of the authorities would be seen as way out of proportion.     Under a Policing Frame, the protagonist could have adopted a    Martin Luther King    Frame and used his powerful IT skills to upgrade this historic frame into the 21st century.   The Arab Spring Frame showed bits and pieces needed for this updating, but did not use enough of the Martin Luther King Frame to show the power that an update of this frame could have.   The author, through the protagonist, could have then won the day, and taught the reader a world-changing lesson in the process.    In short, a great possibility for this story was in view but the author blew it because he does not understand his own history.

George Lakoff, The Political Mind:   A Cognitive Scientist   s Guide to Your Brain and Its Politics (Penguin, 2009)      ;Communism and Anti-Communism were both powerful Frames that drove the action for most of the 20th century.   Neither one achieved very much and both wasted enormous amounts of resources, but they did produce a lot of good stories (James Bond, etc.).   Replacing them with the War on Terror Frame is certainly likely to waste enormous resources and reduce personal liberty, but it doubt that it will produce much in the way of good story lines.;That was fast.I am not much worried about the character here.   What I regret is the author setting up the character to lose.   A 19 year old kid losing is not much of a story.

The telephone story broke a few weeks after the double bombing in Boston by two rogue actors with pressure cooker bombs.   In Doctorow   s story he has a double major bombing that could only be carried out by a large and well organized terrorist group.   After such an event the approval reading for extreme surveillance would be closer to 98% judging from 9/11.    The protagonist   s unrelated activities would surely draw attention and he would be detained indefinitely ending the story.   A much smaller incident and a clear over reaction from the authorities would have made a much better plot with a balance between more closely argued stands.    We will have to see how the    James Bond in the 21st century    frame plays out but after we add Big Data and killer drones to Bond   s usually gaggle of gadgets, the American people still want Bond on their side.    Reference:       Majority Views NSA Pho9ne Tracking as Acceptable Anti-terror Tactic    (Internet) http://www.people-press.org/2013/06/10/majority-views-nsa-phone-tracking-as-acceptable-anti-terror-tactic/    ;A new round of summertime science Fiction blockbuster movies is out and     they are letting us down by failing miserably to depict a believable future     for manned space exploration.   Stating with    Oblivion    and continuing     through the summer, each film costs more than $100,000,000; each has flawless,     breathtaking computer generated graphics; and each portrays a negative     future for human kind full of wars, terrorist acts, and ecological collapse.       The American people are owed something much better for their box office     money.   Apollo to the Moon made everybody   s top ten achievements of the 20th century.       There is no reason that a bold, adventurous space program cannot be in     the top ten lists for the 21st.   But to make that happen, billions     of people have to envision the action as a personal success, just as they     did Apollo.   In the 20th century specialists designed a major program, like Apollo,     and then leaders sold it to the public,    We shall go to the Moon  _   .       In the 21st century this entire process now runs backwards.   The first     step is now to envision the adventure in such a way that the idea runs     viral on the Internet and social media.   Then, if and only if, tens     of millions of people buy into the idea will there be any possibility that     the resources will be made available.  A new space mission idea now has to beat out    kitten playing the piano        before it can even get started.   So far, returning to the Moon and     going to an asteroid have both failed miserably in this bazaar contest.       New century; new rules.   Fortunately the new century has come with new tools.   The Silicon     Valley style entrepreneurial companies have lead the way.     Now     the universities are filling in their foggy thinking with solid academic     information on how the new process actually works.   The new system     may be running at the edge of Chaos, but it is now workable as a plan.   Today we must succeed spectacularly with a breakthrough idea, called a     Black Swan, because breakthroughs are the new norm.   Running hundreds     of small projects that win small or fail fast is now understood as the     plan of action     Plan >> Do >> Test >> Learn >>     Repeat --.   You never risk more than you can afford to lose and the     emphasis is always on Do. You are antifragile, not hurt by uncertainty,     you prosper from it.   It is your persistence in repetition that makes     sure you are there when a Black Swan wins.   There are now so many Black Swans in play that they have become the defining     concept of the 21st century.   Historically science fiction generated the vision that lead to Apollo     to the Moon and solutions of many other problems of we the people of Earth.       Current blockbuster movies do not do this, perhaps they cannot.   Fortunately     there is a new democratic movement on the Internet that I think can.   Yes, there are problems.   Chiefly resources spent on space exploration     are not available for working other real world problems.   This is     why programs must be widely appreciated before major resources can be applied.  We can organize to generate our vision.   We can tell the story before     the adventure happens and by so doing make the adventure happen.         The process will require diverse teams of technical people to work out     the implications of current science and humanities people to work out the     language, dialog, and characters.   Modern social media on the Internet     can do this job very well.   We have started small with an e-book of science fiction short stories     called Hard Squared Science Fiction, Vol. 01 and have started Vol. 02.   We have a     working site in the social knowledge site, So:Kno, under the title    Romancing     Black Swans    and are working up clear statements of why and how.   If your vision is of the human race moving out into space and it can embrace     teams of millions of Earth-bond participants active in the adventure, then     please join us.

Both qualities of the human brain are now well understood. The human mental condition where a person gets so intensely involved in an activity that he or she looses all track of time and personal comfort is now called ""Flow"" and is very well studied.   It can occur in any human activity.   In creative writing, authors described the state as the words flowing like a river, hence the name.   In music it is called being ""in the Groove"".   In sports it is ""in the Zone"".   Flow is a very enjoyable state of mind.Modern humans also have another mental state ""Buy-in"".   Under buy-in a person accepts and idea as his mission, gets in action on the idea, and stays in action on the idea.

I'm not sure I necessarily agree with you but your discussion is well rounded and was interesting to read.If you wanted to improve your essay I would suggest that you explore why you have assigned each aspect to each creature and how this reflects on the journey the cock makes through life (for example: why does the 'stone of acceptance' let the cock and hen across but drown all the other creatures that followed them? What makes the Willow complacent? Why is the brook both apathetic and an expression of tribulation?)   I hope that this review if of some interest to you and applaud you for posting your essay publicly, please accept these comments in the spirit in which they are intended!;"

It's hard to put into words but  as an example:You wrote:Alice first sees her chess board to be played as she and the Red Queen reach the top of the hill.   Alice, while looking out at the countryside declares,    It   s marked out just like a large chessboard.    (p.30)You could say:Alice first comments on the game of chess when she looks out over the countryside and declares     It   s marked out just like a large chessboard.    (p.30)I'm not  entirely happy with my sentence but I hope you can see what I mean!The only other thing I'd say is that whilst your last paragraph draws comparisons with Harry Potter you don't really say why it is interesting that they both use chessboards - I think that you could have linked this back to your thesis and  explained  why the metaphor of the game of chess appears across different  children's  novels.;Since I've commented it seems only fair to share my own essay! I noticed the errors in the last sentence just  after the deadline to correct them passed :(Alice in Wonderland - Lewis Carroll (Overall Score 4)In Alice's Adventures in Wonderland the Mock Turtle is source of many linguistic puns. When Alice first hears about him ""[she doesn't] even know what a Mock Turtle is"" until the Queen educates her by saying that ""It's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from"".   In Victorian England Mock Turtle Soup used the head and hooves of a calf to imitate turtle meat and in Tenniel's illustration the Mock Turtle has the head and feet of a calf but the body of a turtle. Carroll makes a clever dual pun out of the Mock Turtle's name - it is both a play on the nature of the soup (which is pretending to be something it is not) and on the nature of the turtle (which literally embodies its peculiar name).As Alice continues talking with the Mock Turtle more puns are introduced - Mock Turtle discusses his school life (a topic to which the child reader can easily relate) and refers to master ""Tortoise"".   When Alice questions why a turtle would be called 'tortoise' she is informed that is is because he ""taught us"" - this is an example of a homophone, a device which Carroll uses throughout the novel for comedic effect. The chapter continues with puns on school topics, for example ""Reeling"" and ""Writhing"" replace ""Reading"" and ""Writing"". The puns in Alice in Wonderland are fairly obvious and are often expressly identified by the characters in the book - this is interesting as it shows us that Carroll was writing carefully for his intended audience.   If the child reader misses the wordplay it is brought to their attention and if they identified it themselves then they gain a sense of achievement for spotting it before the characters did.   In this way Alice's adventures are both amuse the young reader and a encourage them to think carefully about language and inspire them to use it creatively.Form - 2peer 1     So glad to see someone really enjoying the sad tales from the Mock Turtle episode and your including your research in a clear, concise way is also remarkable.peer 2     The student uses form and grammar correctly but some areas need commas in certain places and attention to details on various articles that are used. For example, In the first sentence, In Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,(comma) the Mock Turtle is (a)source of many linguistic puns. Also, in this sentence, In Victorian England, (comma) Mock Turtle Soup used the head and hooves of a calf to imitate turtle meat and in Tenniel's illustration the Mock Turtle has the head and feet of a calf but the body of a turtle. There are a few misspelled words and articles that are used twice. Possibly proofreading and having someone else read for you would make it perfect.peer 3     The structure of your essay was smooth and the progression was logical but there were some errors in your final sentence. Make sure to proofread carefully because these are easy to avoid.peer 4     You write well and you laid out a clear argument.Content - 2peer 1     Content offers insightful analysis and some research, thank you!peer 2     The content of the essay is great! I learned quite a bit from this essay. I would suggest to put the 3rd paragraph first but otherwise this student is on the right track. One thing I learned is that reading this book is interesting because of the puns that are used.peer 3     I enjoyed how specific the focus of your essay was but I would caution against using Wikipedia as a source since it can be easily altered. Instead, I would suggest using it as a springboard to find morr information.peer 4     This is a well-structured essay. If there was more room, you could have perhaps set up some of your concluding ideas in your introduction.;I've been reviewing assignments this evening and one writer has noted that Count Dracula is unable to enter a home unless he is invited and that he is unable to seduce an unwilling victim.My immediate response was that those 'facts' are incorrect but I am cautious about disputing this without being certain (and I did not focus my essay on this area so I am not certain).   Can anyone point me to any quotes from the book which support the assertions the writer of the essay has made?   My thoughts are thus:Whilst Dracula's entry to the asylum is facilitated by an invitation he is also shown to be able to circumvent the necessity for an invitation. Dracula uses a wolf to break into Lucy's bedroom through her window and I'm not sure why he would do this if he had been invited into the house previously?I can also find no reference to the women being willing in the text. Dracula comes to Mina when she is drugged with a sleeping draught and threatens her with the death of her husband if she dares resist him and is said to be restraining  her as he feeds - to my mind this does not indicate 'willingness'!Having said that - I'd love to be proven wrong!;Ah, perfect - thank you.   I guess the wolf-through-the-window must have been to circumvent the garlic protections and that Lucy must have invited him into the house at some point previously.I very much appreciate you taking the time to point out the quote to me.;"

The scales, again, are Structure (SR),  Diversity (DV), Recognition (RE), Autonomy (AT), Environment  (EN), Expression (EX), Teamwork (TW), Stability (SB), Balance  (BA), Career Growth (CG), and Compensation.  Structure: Having high expectations about structure means that  you want clear instructions regarding what to do, how to do it, and  what resources are available to you.  Diversity: Having high expectations about diversity means that  you want to work with people from a variety of backgrounds and/or  with varied points of view.  Recognition: Having high expectations about recognition means  that you want a work environment where good work is  acknowledged and rewarded.  Autonomy: Having high expectations about autonomy means that  you want to have the independence or freedom to make decisions  about how you will do your job.  Environment: Having high expectations about environment  means that you see a connection between the social and physical  work environment and your well-being.  Expression: Having high expectations about expression means  that you want a work environment that allows you to share your  opinions and feelings openly.  Teamwork: Having high expectations about teamwork means that  you expect collaboration to be a highly valued and commonly used  method for reaching work objectives.  Stability: Having high expectations about stability means that you  want job security and a work environment that remains relatively  unchanged.Balance: Having high expectations about balance means that you  have personal and professional goals and that you want others to  understand the importance of all of your commitments.  Career Growth: Having high expectations about career growth  means that you want to make progress toward your professional  goals.   2001 by Inscape Publishing, Inc.

I'll be sure to use it.  ;thanks :);Here's what I got on this: ....On page 208, Van Helsing says this to Dr. Seward :     ...we shall have an open mind, and not let a little bit of truth check the rush of the big truth, like a small rock does a railway truck. We get the small truth first. Good! We keep him, and we value him, but all the same we must not let him think himself all the truth in the universe.   I think the ""little bit of truth"" and ""small truth""   is science and ""big truth""   and ""all the truth in the universe"" is religion. Acknowledge the truth of science but believe in the truth of religion.  He also says:  ""I want you to believe...to believe in things that you cannot. Let me illustrate. I heard once of an American who so defined faith,    that faculty which enables us to believe things which we know to be untrue.""Here I think the word ""know"" refers to our scientific knowledge. By scientific knowledge, we ""know"" certain things to be untrue. But faith lets us believe these untrue things because faith does not require scientific knowledge.  Stoker obviously values science and see the importance of it. But he also seems heavily religious and stresses the importance of having faith. Both are true, but one is a bigger truth than the other; one encompasses the other.  ;I just thought of this and wondered if its valid or means anything.  Jesus was killed, he descended into Hell, rose from the dead, and ascended into Heaven.  Lucy was killed, she ""rose"" from the dead and became part of the undead which is like hell since eternal damnation and all that, and then she was saved by the holy wafer and probably went to heaven judging by the look of peace on her face.

God created Adam.  Dr. Frankenstein created his monster.  God saw that Adam was lonely and made him a bride, Eve.  With this alone, it seems easy to say that Victor should do likewise for his monster.  But here's the question: Is Dr. Frankenstein God? The answer is quite simply no.  Although Dr. Frankenstein created life in a pale imitation of God, he is not a God and will never be able to do what He does. God created a wife for Adam that loves him. God can make that guarantee of requited love while Dr. Frankenstein can not.  Like God, Dr. Frankenstein has responsibility over his creation. Unlike God, Dr. Frankenstein is unable to meet them.  When you pose the question of whether Dr. Frankenstein should create a female monster for his male monster you also pose the question:   Should Dr. Frankenstein dabble in playing God?  ;The monster is incredibly insightful at times and horrifically violent at others.

Tom, the project sounds fascinating.;I don't know that my taste in Fantasy is particularly mature but, I love anything by Anne McCaffery, J.R.R. Tolkien or C.S. Lewis.

There's no way of knowing exactly how old these stories are, or how the original story actually went.

It's also interesting to ponder what changes may have occurred....perhaps the ""needle"" and other inanimate objects were actually meant to portray certain people the storyteller knew?;Great question for discussion.   I am enjoying the answers, thoughts and thinking on this.   But I think nothing is set in stone, that the definitions for the fantasy genre are like the definitions of poetry that one adheres to which says more about the values, aestetics, culture, education and even time period (and a myriad of other factors) in which the poet is writing than it does about the absolute properties of the what poetry is, or can be.;Being concerned about the issue myself, I will avidly await the answer along with you. Having said that, I won't allow it to influence my decision to try and take everything I can out of the course. Of course, not every critique is helpful - as an aspiring writer who participates in online writing groups I know that all too well - but not venturing out there to see if maybe something constructive comes my way too seems even less productive.Not trying to persuade, just my opinion;I assumed that the essays are graded independently by staff at the university and that we are only grading them as an exercise to give us practice at critically evaluating people's responses to the texts. It would seem odd if the final grade was influenced by the feedback that students would give other students and that this is used to measure our participation in the course and it is taken into consideration for the final grade in that way. I don't consider myself qualified to ""mark"" other people's work in a way that contribute to their final grade so I can't see the grades we give other students to be part of it. It would be better if it was clarified though to avoid confusion. ;Katrina, I understand your issue with the grading and I respect your issues with it. This situation reminds me of an issue I've had in my own courses when trying (forcing?) students to understand the benefits of peer review. The ideal is that students, when acting as reviewers, learn to become better critics of ideas and their own writing by having something more tangible than participation points at stake. When my students felt they were being held accountable by other students for their own grades and were accountable for the grades they gave others, they handled peer review with a new sense of seriousness and purpose. Further, my students reported that it made them feel like they were actually contributing to knowledge both on content and form by helping their peers. They began to see themselves as part of a scholarly community Instead of feeling like high schoolers being given inane tasks to complete. It helped them refine their scholarly voices and gain security in the fact that they could (and needed to!) provide thought-provoking and critical analysis to their peers - a skill necessary both in the classroom, on blog posts/forums, and in the greater community while in the workplace or over a beer. I've interpreted Prof. Rabkin's grading criteria in light of these experiences in my own classroom. It's not the most ideal situation to base a course ""grade"" on only peer-reviewed material, but I think it helps develop the scholarly community he's aiming for given the skills he wants us to have at the end of the course. With your Mythology course, I wonder what would stop a ""robot"" to be built that fills in all the blanks with Lorem Ipsum instead of a real, flesh student writing critically on the assigned materials? While there could be a system implemented where reviewers ""flag"" posts like that, if I, as a student, saw multiple ones like that in the span of the course, I'd start questioning the legitimacy of the course and Coursera as a medium. (not to say I've seen this happen, but just to pose a hypothetical). I look forward to your thoughts on this as a fellow educator!;As a fellow teacher, encouraging students to take this course, that is also my take Danielle. Professor explained very well what was required and how it will improve the skill set of all students taking this course.  ;Yeah, I think you are raising a fair point, Katrina. I had similar concerns (along the lines of ""would students know what they're doing?"") the first time I came across it here on Coursera, but so far I have nothing but good experiences with it. A professor in another course said that after looking through the results from a previous version of his course, it turned out that students mark each other very similarly to what he himself would have done.This being said, you, or anyone else, should certainly bring it up again if the feedback you're getting is unfair. :);(N.B. I am not a teacher nor a professional of any stripe - below are just my personal experiences.)I too was concerned about peer review when I first found coursera. It makes practical sense to use it, thanks to the huge enrollment numbers, and I'm sure in the aggregate, the peer review grades average out to something fair.In the previous class I've taken (Dr. Hagen's fantastic AIDS course) I found that my final grade accurately reflected my work as a whole. That said, there were a few essays where the peer reviewers took off points, and then could not comment coherently as to why.  In the case of one particular essay, it was obvious that my word choices had outstripped the knowledge of three different non-native English speakers; all three left comments that demonstrated they either hadn't read, or hadn't understood my essay. I felt bad about the misunderstanding; I respect anyone who has the drive to take a class in a second (third, fourth, etc) language! But at the same time, I was upset about essentially being ""punished"" for delving into the topic in greater depth. I found myself writing with very simple language and striving to make my points blatantly obvious (and not in a good way - things like literally writing ""The first statement significant to me is.... the second statement significant to me is...."") for the rest of the course, so as to not find myself penalized due to a peer's difficulties in reading English.Even with that, one person whose English was perfect docked a later essay for ""not having a thesis or conclusion."" Fair enough, except, since this was after I'd already decided to break out the sledgehammer and abandon all subtleties, the essay in question included blinking neon signs in the form of that awful phrase, ""I will argue that A, B, C"" and the close second in terms of pedestrian tell-not-showing phrases, ""In conclusion...""I just might have had to walk away from the computer for several minutes the afternoon that review came back. And count to a hundred. And remind myself I was still going to get a very good grade, so it didn't matter much. But arrrrgh.But the grading system as a whole is not going to change, because it can't practicably use professors and TAs to grade however many thousand essays are at stake.Some advice, therefore, for my fellow peer reviewers, especially those whose written English skills are not very strong (you can be a native English speaker and still have difficulty with the written word - ask anyone who's dyslexic!):Read slowly and carefully.Read the whole essay. Then read it a second time. Make sure you understand what the writer is trying to say. (There was a lot of whining in the AIDS class that people just didn't have *time* to read *so many* (5) essays! I'm sympathetic to that, but if you don't have the time to evaluate your peers *carefully* - as carefully as you yourself would hope to be graded - then please, don't participate in the essay portion of the class.)If you don't understand what the writer is trying to say, ask yourself whether they are writing unclearly, or whether your reading comprehension might be the issue. If you are a non-native speaker, dyslexic, if you're *grading* someone who might be a non-native English speaker or dyslexic, or if you're in a rush despite yourself, you owe it to your classmates to be *especially* careful to make sure you haven't missed something. If a writer uses a word you don't know, look it up. If that sheds no light, ask on the boards... many people will be happy to help. Yo no hablo espa  ol bien en estos d _as, pero puedo leer lo suficientemente bien como para ayudar a los estudiantes que necesitan un poco de ayuda de la traducci _n. (hopefully I have conjugated that *mostly* correctly or my tio will be very disappointed with me! :) )By all means, critique - that is the point of this class, for learning cannot take place without criticism. But make sure it's ""attentive, intelligent"" criticism, to borrow from Prof. Rabkin. ""I didn't like this"" or ""you didn't do this well"" aren't helpful. ""I found the middle of your essay confusing because A doesn't seem to have much to do with B"" is a helpful comment. The same applies to ""good""... not helpful. ""I liked what you said about food meanings, it made me see the text in a different way."" That's helpful. You don't have to write a long or complicated comment to be helpful, just say something interesting. If you are a non-native speaker who finds commenting difficult in English, by all means, type your comment into google translate and paste the English translation into the comment box. I would rather get a very thoughtful comment in computer-translated English than a ""good"" or ""not good"" from a self conscious reviewer.And finally, just to reiterate, I have *profound* respect for the non-native English speakers taking this course. I could not take a course in Spanish or Irish (my two other languages) at this level and follow along. I also want to acknowledge that there are plenty of non-native English speakers out there whose English skills are better than mine - I tip my hat to you, too.If we all respect each other and do our best work (with reviewing as well as writing), everything will work out fine.;Katrina,I fully understand your reservations, believe me! I still share them - that's why I would *never* sign up for the signature track (which involves paying a significant amount of money to take the same class and have your grade considered certified and accredited) for a class like this. I simply don't trust the peer review system that much! I was just taking the opportunity on a thread about peer reviewing to elaborate on how those of us who *will* be participating in the peer review portion can do our best to be fair and informed toward our classmates. I completely respect your decision, and I wish there were easier ways for MOOCs like Coursera to deal with graded essays. I'm embarrassed to admit it, but I don't think I would put nearly as much effort into a ""participation only"" essay as a graded one - in a classroom, as part of a for-credit course, I would, but for a free course that isn't for any credit, I would struggle to feel like the work I put in *meant* something if all I got at the end was a ""yeah, you typed something in the box.""I suspect that a peer review system is the best out of a bunch of not-great options for Coursera as a whole. Individual Coursera classes might have better options to fit that specific material - for example, in the AIDS class, we discussed the possibility of making a ""dual track"" available - one for people who didn't want to write essays/didn't feel comfortable with peer review, and one for people who wanted to write essays and/or didn't feel comfortable with quizzes being their only coursework. One of my other classes is quizzes only, and for that material, it works fine. Peer review that doesn't actually count for a grade would demotivate *me*, but that doesn't make it an invalid option. And so on.I certainly didn't feel like you were trying to tell the professor how to run his class. I've witnessed people *actually* doing that, and those people have never been as polite as you are. In addition to that, I've known a lot of educators in my life (my mother is a school bus driver and I've worked as an informal paraprofessional in special ed classrooms off and on for many years, as our district is chronically shorthanded in that area), and I know no educator who would think of doing such a thing!So, no worries. Your point of view is well taken and was well expressed. Don't worry about the rude commenters - such is the way of the internet. Enjoy the class!;One of Vertigo's tamer series and I still love it. Personally Jack of Fables is my favourite, his personality straddles the line between the darker and lighter side of fairy tales.  ;I've read a bunch of them, and really love them.

It's a wonderful comic series but very hard to find in Mexico.  ;I Katrina. What I'd like to know is what stories do we have to read for next week....there's a LOT of them.I used that website to learn Danish, you can have the same tale written in two different language one besides the other, so you can compare them.By the way, I remember your name, but I am not sure from which course...Greek Mythology?;I see that we've got a GoodReads group, so I created one for LibraryThing too:http://www.librarything.com/groups/fantasyandscienceficAnd here's my (woefully incomplete) profile there:http://www.librarything.com/profile/nadyne.richmond;Hello, here goes my (rather incomplete) list:Movies (in no particular order):  -SF:MatrixAnimatrixAvalonDonnie DarkoAkira12 Monkeys  -Fantasy:Spirited Away.Princess Mononoke.Nausicaa.Howl's Moving Castle.LOTR The two towers.About TV series I think I do not know a lot but as more people bring them up, I'll remember them. Neon Genesis Evangelion would be there, as well as Last Exile and Gundam Wing. Game of Thrones would also appear on my list.;I haven't read the book (which I hope to find soon), butI particularly like what Studo Ghibli does, although anime as a general rule is not what I most like, I saw a fair share some years ago, but it gets repetitive quickly, except for Ghibli's productions.I never saw Firefly, I could only get the movie, Serenity, which I enjoyed. About the Neverending Story... I'm such a shame hehe I have never watched it.Regarding books, have you read anything within Orson Scott Card's Enderverse? I'm looking forward to Ender's Game movie this year.;Carolyn, On a side note, I noticed that you have Blade Runner on your list and thought worth mentioning that the movie was loosely based on a novel called 'Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep' by Philip K. Dick, who also wrote another book called 'A Scanner Darkly' witch was made into a moderately successful animated movie.;For anime, try Samurai Champloo if you've not seen it. And I'll always love Avatar: The Last Airbender (the cartoon, NOT the awful movie). That was a quality show. ;You should totally watch Doctor Who. You can start with the new stuff (Christopher Eccleston), no need to go back to the very first season if you don't want to. It's really good. ;To me, It always felt a bit incomplete.;I also love Game of Thrones, read all the books (currently written at the time) and then reread them when the HBO show came out (by the way, I'm so happy with this show: it is one of the better, if not the best, adaptations I've seen).I think all of your comments are really well made. The characterization is amazing for me, brought to life because of how Martin writes the narrative. The story is like a game of Risk, where certain ""colors"" or families win some, then lose some, with each consecutive roll of the dice, but they all have the same goal. I, of course, love all of the core characters, but there are many minor characters that I wish Martin would have latched on to and written in as one of the narrative characters because I want to learn so much more about them.;"

Especially those which are older. I like Grimm's stories and folktales in general: they are amusing, there is implicit wisdom in them, but they are too contradictory to be a guide. You should already have some views upon the world to discriminate between right and wrong.I appreciate folktales but prefer authored stories. I like to meet a personal position. And I'm too modern: I need a logically consistent plot. :D;This is interesting. I also had the thought that perhaps the step-mother is often wicked/evil in these stories because divorce was not as common as it is in certain areas of the world today, so a step-mother often meant that your biological mother was dead. This may add an extra layer to the reason for not-so-nice step-mothers, a further psychological aspect. In some of the stories this is explicitly stated - Aschenputtel's mother is dead, for instance. She goes to visit her grave every day and she also plants the hazel-stick there. I am wondering, in other tales where there is a step-mother but it is not explicitly mentioned that the biological mother has died, if this was just assumed. Today, it is not uncommon to see families with single parents and/or step-parents from divorce. Back then, in Germany and other areas where these tales were prominent, my bet is that a step-parent only comes into the picture by a widow re-marrying (after the death of the first parent).  ;also don't be too concerned, you need a 1,8 average on your best assignments.If you submit anything, you'll get a minimum of 2... so the peer evaluations are really there for you to learn from and not to determine who passes the course.(i think that's correct - feel free to correct me on my math) :P;Katrina,I totally understand your point.   After reading some of the fb comments for this course from a previous class, I am even more concerned about being graded solely on peer reviews.   Comments (assumptions) were made about whether the writer was a native english speaker, differences in grammar/punctuation correction in each essay (this is incorrect, then they would change it to the recommended correctness, and that would be incorrect), to being graded down for taking a point that differed from the book (most common example was in Frankenstein when choosing the creator as the real monster).   Many in this class do not have any *real* instruction in grading, reviewing, etc. as most are not teachers, or going to school to become a teacher.   We also will run into the problem of *opinion* and we all know the saying about that.   It doesn't seem equitable that our grade is figured from the peer reviews themselves.   It is also ambiguous because the instructor states in the video that if you do all 10 essays you will have an A.   Not true because if you score low on the essays you will not.   Especially since ""rarely"" should there be a 3, which would, imho, classify as an A.   2, imho, would revert to a B/C, and a 1 an F.   I would more think that since this a pass/fail (which does not mean that we should ""chill"" and not be concerned about grades...yes, we are doing this for our enrichment, but many of us still care deeply about the grade)that doing the assignments appropriately and turning them all in, doing your peer reviews, etc should garner your grade, not the reviews themselves.;Thanks, Katrina. That's nice of you to say.;Fables is amazing.   Also interesting to note that the fables in this incarnation retain their power to some extent by force of belief,   This goes right with the reading of Grimm and why they remain so prominent.   It is not just that the stories are that good, but that since so many have heard them, they gain force by shear prevalence.   (Which is also the theme of another comic/graphic novel, Unwritten.);What bums me out is when I try to introduce people to those particular comics and I'm written off because comics are just Superheroes right? Gah. Comics and Graphic Novels are a legit literary genre, in my opinion. Most comics aren't really meant for children. If I had a child, I wouldn't let them read some of the things I've picked up until they were a bit older.  ;Exactly.  People who think comics are for children just do not know.  Maus and Watcmen both garnered their creators Pulitzers.  It is inventive literature.  Some of the most forward thinking writing is in graphic format.  McLuhan is wrong.  Media is not the message.   ;I'm with you, Katrina!   The Black Cauldron was one of the rare movies I saw multiple times in the theater and it led me to check out The Prydain Chronicles from the school library to get Taran's whole story.   This was when they were still in individual books.   I later bought the compilation from The Science Fiction Book Club some years later.Titan A.E. is one of my favorite animated movies as well.   Don Bluth animated the game Dragon's Lair (and others) and I like his style.   The story is fairly cliche, but not overly so.   The bleak human future is an unpopular setting to many because it's ""our team"" that's losing.   I can see how the common mind would chafe on that.   I like the ""overcoming adversity"" stories.   The worse the conditions, the sweeter the victory.One final observation:   Both of those movies do well with me because neither of them were made with any ""sing along"" songs.   Name another Disney animated movie that doesn't have any songs in it.   I can't think of any.   Yes Titan A.E. had some rockin' soundtracks, but the characters weren't yippy-skippying about vocalizing their feelings in harmony.   Yeesh.;It's really iteresting to see the similarities between fairy tales in different times and places, definitely what one could call ""collective consciousness"", this also works for myths and legends.;Tyrion is my favorite. Who doesn't love him? But I also really like Jorah and Daenerys both. I'm not too fond of any of the Stark kids, but I did love Ned Stark.;Besides Grimm, Dracula, and Oedipus for another course, I'm reading The Hero: A Study in Tradition, Myth, and Drama by Lord Raglan, and I'm rereading Isabel Allende's House of the Spirits because I want to propose a unit plan to teach that book next year.;Grimm's Fairy Tales!!

Here's one of Snow White:;I understand all of the points brought up...but what is the alternative? Censorship? We've come so far in this area, I do not want to go backwards. It's wrong to think that an issue will go away just by avoiding it. I mean, ignorance may really be bliss, but I'd rather be knowledgable.  Please remember that most of us on this course are adults or if not, we're mature enough to know not to go around repeating offensive words or actions just because we read them in a book. If it really bothers you that much, try to keep in mind that they are fantasy and sci-fi works. Yes, they may include reflections of real society and ways of life, but if you don't want to focus on that in order to feel less 'uncomfortable' you can opt not to.;The children were the prince's. In my version Maria Tatar wrote:  Rapunzel becomes a ""wife"" because the Grimms did not want to suggest that Rapunzel's twins were born out of wedlock.She is referring to the passage where the witch says to the prince: ""You want to come get your darling little wife, but the beautiful bird is no longer sitting in the nest, singing her songs."";The version I have is The Annotated Brothers Grimm:http://www.amazon.com/Annotated-Brothers-Grimm-Bicentennial-Edition/dp/0393088863/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8...;See, I read this in a different way. To me, the witch or enchantress had purposely put the delicious looking rapunzel in the garden so that the woman would see it and crave it. Perhaps she even put a spell on the rapunzel because it had such a powerful impact on the woman: ""she began to waste away because she was afraid she would never get any of it."" Since the woman had just gotten pregnant, I felt that the witch (who is also called a fairy in some other versions) was playing on the cravings that pregnant women might get and purposely making the rapunzel look so appetizing, and then, of course, making it taste so good.;I love how there are so many different interpretations to these tales. It makes for some interesting and insightful conversations.  Peter: You may think that the witch was not cruel to Rapunzel, but how much more cruel can you be locking a child up in a tower? That's imprisonment! For doing absolutely nothing; her freedom is taken from her for the sins of her parents. There is a prison in Philadelphia called the Eastern State Penitentiary in which prisoners were kept in solitary confinement so as to reflect on their sins and hopefully, repent. In reality, many of them went insane because of the lack of human contact. The prison reformed a number of times over the years and finally shut down in the 1970s. John Graham also brought up a great point about real children being raised in captivity. It is horrible, and if you ask me, the witch got off too easy for doing that to Rapunzel in the first place.  There are many different versions of the story of Medusa, too, but it's interesting that you brought her up. One version said that she boasted about her beauty too much so Athena punished her vanity by taking that beauty away. Another version said that she seduced Poseidon in Athena's temple, and finally there's the version that she was raped in Athena's temple; either way she was turned into a gorgon by Athena. With this story, it is often argued that had Medusa not been in the temple, the punishment would have been a lot less severe (if there was a punishment at all). Athena was not angry about the coupling, she was angry that it happened in her temple (being a virgin goddess and all). One of the main warnings in this myth is to not defile sacred sites...which differs somewhat from Rapunzel, but I do see the connection. Good thinking.;Peter,You are right about that particular rape victim version of the story, but that is not one of the older versions of Medusa. It is actually one of the new versions, coming with Ovid. Sorry to correct you on this, but I did a report on Medusa so I have studied her a lot.   : /    Actually, the oldest version of Medusa's name having showed up is one in which she was never human, but a sister of Stheno and Euryale, one of the daughters of Phorcys and Keto/Ceto. Medusa was the only mortal one in the trio, and thus, able to be killed by Perseus. Again, as with all Greek myths, there are many variations, more than I have described.  I do see what you mean about a protected treasure, but that is just what I am trying to point out. By 'protecting' a child from the world, it's like you're treating her as a piece of property, hoarding an object, like Gollum with his precious ring. That is a very sinister thing to do to a human being. Not only would you stunt the mind of a child, but probably the health and growth by locking them away in such a manner. If you don't doom them outright to insanity, as I said earlier. How is that okay? How will a child raised in such a way ever be able to function in the real world? How much have they missed being shut away their whole life? It's almost on par with abortion.;L. Frank Baum and Mark Twain from posting some of my children's writing. Love both, so I'm happy.;"

They wanted to foster a sense of unity. I don't think the Professor was harsh at all. It is only because you know about Nazi Germany that you're looking back at that way. But if the Professor said the same things and the Nazis had never come to power, you would not be thinking along these lines.And yeah, there were tons of countries at this time, before, and after that also wanted nationalism for their country.  ;You must read the annotated version if you do not think that Alice is absolutely brilliant (and a whole heck of a lot of fun to boot)! Martin Gardner, in the Introduction to my annotated book writes: ""The fact is that Carroll's nonsense is not nearly as random and pointless as it seems to a modern American child who tries to read the Alice books."" There are many, MANY inside jokes that we don't get as readers from a different time, culture, and even academic level. Carroll was most certainly an interesting fellow, for a variety of reasons, but one thing is certain: he ""was a skilled storyteller."" The numerous interpretations, studies, analyses, and general interest in his work by thousands of people prove that, if nothing else.;Suzanne,I think you should really take what most people are saying on here into consideration. I am curious as to what other classic literature you have read. Have you read any Shakespeare? Steinbeck? Jonathan Swift? How about any of the Arabian tales? Greek, Egyptian, or Norse myths? Chinese myths? One could argue that a lot of the timeless literature is riddled with violence; much more than you see in the fairy tales.I have read every book or story that is required for this course except for Herland. And, everyone else above is absolutely right. These tales are tame compared to some of what we will be delving into. If you are outraged now, you will blow your top soon. I respect your feelings, but urge you that if you are not yet ready to study these works seriously despite all of the violence, you might want to reconsider taking this course when and if you are.As for me, I am more outraged when I turn on the news than at any other time. Perhaps our own contemporary world would be less violent today if it could learn from the past violence in history and even in fictional literature.On a lighter note (and hopefully to make you laugh a little) I read and loved the Grimm fairy tales, as well as Andersen's tales, too, when I was a child. And they were not the watered down versions, but from an old series of my grandmothers (not sure if it was Lucy Crane or not). I never had any nightmares about them that I recall. You want to know what terrified me? The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. I had a stuffed Winnie-the-Pooh bear that I slept with (and still do, but shhh, don't tell anyone) and I dreamed that the Turtles kidnapped me and Pooh and hid him in a hole somewhere in the sewer. I still can remember vividly the horrifying experience of my dream where I was running through the sewer looking for Pooh, trying to be quiet and not scream when I stepped on rats as big as Splinter so that I didn't alert the Turtles. Go ahead and laugh at this, or at least smile, but that dream really did scare me half to death when I was younger.;This letterplay is straight from my annotated version: Notice the number of letters in each name, and the two double consonant sets (and where they are placed) in the surnames.Alice LiddellLewis CarrollAlso, Dear Lewis Carroll have the initials DLC which are CLD backwards, the initials for Charles Lutwidge Dodgson. Fun!;Most of the times, I would prefer the books. Poor Alan Moore's incredible works were made into awful movies. I was so sad that Stardust by Neil Gaiman was not such a great movie either (I would have loved it if they made an animated movie in de Lint style).  Sometimes, though, I can really enjoy both the movies and the books, separately and as variations of each other. For instance, Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit (so far) are really well done in film form, but there is a lot that is missing from the books (understandably) so I can enjoy both as separate works of art and know that one was inspired by the other. Another example, though a show, is HBO's Game of Thrones.  I was a collector of Spider-Man comics as a young girl and I was thrilled to see the first movie and how it was reinvented, though inspired, by the original story line.  I have yet to see Gatsby, though I am the only English teacher you will probably meet who doesn't enjoy this book in the first place....and I, too, am nervous about Ender's Game.;My cousin is a dancer and was just in a professional ballet production of Dracula. It was really stunning and sinister and spooky. I loved every minute of it. Although I despise Twilight and the many imitations, the original Dracula book is very intriguing and entertaining to read.;This is rather a tough question. It completely depends on the book. Some stories are told better in the first person while others are told better in third person limited or third person omniscient.  ;I think it's especially interesting because the word 'mad' has so many different definitions, many of which can apply to Alice and the other Wonderland characters at different times.;Well, I loved Alice when I was younger and still do today. The Annotated Alice is extremely helpful and enriched my experience as a reader.I also love everything about Sandman, and I never thought about it before, but it is quite similar to Alice. Perhaps you didn't just get all the little inside jokes in Alice because it wasn't your time or culture...that's why the Annotated version is really helpful.I also loved the dream sequence in Dumbo and the one in Winnie-the-Pooh (the Heffalumps and Woozles). They are so colorful and fun. Maybe I'm just weird, but I've always loved fantasy sequences like that. I mean, this is a Fantasy/Sci-Fi course after all.;Florencia is absolutely right. Bear in mind, that you are reading his journal, not his thoughts. So, he is writing as a reflection back on what he just went through. Of course he is going to have stereotypical descriptions, as he can only take in, remember, and record so much information, so it's the stuff that appears most often and the stuff that has the largest impact on his mind that he writes down.As for the gay references...where are they? Are you talking about Mina and Lucy? But it seems you've not gotten to them yet? Are you talking about how Harker is studying Dracula so obsessively?;Bram Stoker never visited Transylvania and the geography described in Dracula is not always accurate. He did consult books, but I always read his Transylvania as a fictional place that is only loosely based on the real. He obviously could not have described the country people completely accurately, and only used them as minor characters anyway to set the tone (often such minor characters are stereotypical anyway).Carmen, I do believe you are looking for something that is not quite there. Yes, many English/European writers could be biased and downright racist at times, but Bram Stoker was Irish. He was rather appalled at English oppression because of that fact. Javier is absolutely right about the differences between doctors and peasants (after all, education comes into play here) and if you keep reading, you will find some English characters that are not so gentlemanly. So, I doubt there is any type of racism there.;Well, I am not participating in the essay portion of this course, but I have seen some wonderfully insightful posts in the forums and some that...aren't so wonderfully insightful, but it shows that people are thinking in any case! I know a lot of the students enrolled are not active on the forums, but perhaps there are some that are not putting their full effort into the essays for a variety of reasons. Hopefully you will see improvements next week!;Well, the books do not seem that ancient to me, but that's probably because I'm also in the middle of a Greek and Roman Mythology course. I agree with both Megan and Amber: The required texts are not all that old and it's nice to have as many of them as possible in the public domain. I think the choices were also made on the basis of how much of an impact the texts had on both the genre, and on people/history in general. Most of the titles are recognizable, and a lot of the students on here have read some or most of the works already, meaning they are important to the genre as a whole, and have influenced readers, writers, and scholars alike.;"
FALSE,St159,Coh1,4,0,0,6,14.5129,0.413425,5,0,5,0.00933126,0,"Laura,I'm sure Bram Stoker had some similar views with people of his time regarding race, but I just don't see it in this novel in the way that the OP did. He was indeed Irish, and as you might assume, didn't look favorably on the English as a general rule. Dracula has been interpreted as a satirical text in which Stoker is actually pointing out how the English are frightened of outsiders and outside influence. He goes so far to make them seem horrified by it. There is also an interpretation that Dracula was a metaphor for England as a whole, ""sucking the blood out of people"" just because he could. How accurate these views are is debatable, but it does rather put one off the view of his holding the English higher than any other culture. There is no doubt that he did not accurately describe Transylvania and his inhabitants, as has already been said, but again, other than Dracula (and his women) the Transylvanians were minor characters, meant to add drama and a spooky atmosphere. Many writers make their similar minor characters stereotypical for just that same reason: to create a certain type of atmosphere. ;)  ;It is most acceptable in an academic setting to not use the word ""I"" or ""me"" in an essay. You should not be writing your personal opinion like this: ""I didn't like it very much because...."" but should be more assertive by writing something like this: ""Although this is considered a classic work of literature, there are many flaws, such as....""Hopefully that makes sense.;This is not necessarily true, Paul. I teach English and there is a very powerful urge to get students writing professionally. My teacher training required that students are taught how to write an essay with a strong thesis in the third person. In all of my college level classes (both graduate and undergrad) it was not acceptable to write an academic paper (analysis or essay) in the first person. It was only used in creative writing assignments.  ;https://class.coursera.org/fantasysf-003/forum/thread?thread_id=193;I love Mel Brooks. Have you ever seen Young Frankenstein? A Dracula movie by him would be great. Though, I'm not certain I get all of your song titles... : /;I completely agree with Anna. Looking critically at any text should not take the magic out of it but should add a deeper level of understanding. Alice in Wonderland, for example, seems to have frustrated a lot of people on this forum, but I think the main reason for that is because they did not understand the multiple layers of the literature. I think a lot of people had this notion that it was a children's book and went into the reading thinking it was going to be 'easy' or 'whimsical' when it really takes a sharp mind, some research, and some higher order thinking to fully enjoy the brilliance of the work.  When it comes to creative writing, I have found that all of my literature classes have really intensified my own writing. I don't always write with lots of symbols in mind, or try to include subtle hints about themes in my work, but sometimes I do. A lot of times, I just want to write a fun story with lots of swashbuckling and sword play. Other times, I am in my poetic mood and my writing is much more literary. Either way, reading, analyzing, and discussing other books has greatly improved my own writing. I have found that when I plan a new story, I can jot down a few themes I might want to include and find that I have added many more when I get through it, without even realizing I was doing so. However, I always think to myself that I want my readers to be entertained first, and if my work has informed them about something, inspired them to create something, or made them think deeply about something, that is a bonus.;"

It was amazing that I opened the Wall Street Journal today and spotted a review on   Who Was Dracula? by Jim Steinmeyer. All of you interested in Stoker's relationship with Wilde and Whitman and Irving would probably like to read this book.  Here's a link to an online review:http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323566804578553403814447228.htmlPerhaps the best quote from the review is:""The open-endedness of Stoker's characterization makes it easy for each successive generation to reinvent Dracula according to its own preoccupations."" Certainly we, as contemporary readers are finding things in the book that readers a century ago or even fifty years ago didn't find, of it they did, would never have discussed in public. This ability of Dracula  to affect a wide variety of readers throughout many generations is just one testament to its literary worth.  The same can be said, I think, of many great classic novels.  ;Great idea for a thread, Kristine. I am not participating in the essay portion of this course, but I have been dismayed at all the issues people are having over the peer reviews. I am sincerely sorry that there is so much consternation over them.  I have read everything we've been assigned to read so far, but I am reading it all again and really loving some of the discussions on here about the literature. The lectures are informative, but a little slow-moving for me. I don't know why, but I can only watch a couple at a time and I am not through all of the Dracula ones yet. But I am just going through the course at my own pace.Despite all of the 'I hate this book' comments, I think there have been some great insights on the forums. I have particularly enjoyed some of the discussions about Dracula. I think it's wonderful that people of all different ages and from different cultures can find so many similarities in the works (some 'universal truths' if you will). But it is also fascinating to see how original ideas pop up and how many of us have differing views about a piece. Keep up the great discussions, Courserians!;Greek and Roman Mythology if you're interested. You must write one essay (but you can write two if you choose throughout the course). These essays are peer reviewed, but the numbers given by peers in no way reflect the final grade. Rather, you must take a quiz every week about the readings and the lectures. Trust me, the quizzes are quite difficult and some of the questions really make you think. It is an excellent course if you're interested in the subject.  ;"

Each volume is an independent collaboration.The current story ideas are grouped into themes:1.   Human Space exploration -- This my field and I have three stories available for review.   We now have a storyboard we need expanded into a short story:   http://woodwaredesigns.com/EBook/CepheisDragons.2.   Sustainable Earth -- These are stories about people addressing ecological problems.   We currently have a complex story idea based on a series of TED presentations (space need not be mentioned).3.   First Contact -- Stories about what it would mean to humans to contact star people.

I hope you had a back-up stored somewhere or you have sublimed.;Some very interesting observations here. The thing that jumps out of the pages when I read the TOG series is Martin's diction. Open any book on any page and notice the word choice. Particularly when he is describing a scene or segueing from one event to another. Walking down alleys or across a corridor in a castle the words have a tendency to build up and reinforce a particular colour or image. If he is talking about gold there will be references to candle or sunlight immediately afterwards, if he has written about a sword the word choices will have a quality of sharpness to them in the ensuing sentences.     Yes his ability to create believable and human characters in a fantasy world is remarkable. How does a man in his sixties convincingly write from the perspective of a young girl for example? I feel that this is one of the toughest challenges in writing. This particularly holds true when writing science fiction as there are often times when the writer is faced with the task of creating characters whose frame of reference is completely alien. If anyone has any thoughts on how to achieve this I would be very much appreciative of your input during the course. But truly what makes his books come alive for me is his ability to weave words into a visceral image that drags you into the scene. Consider the title; 'A song of Ice and Fire'. How primal an image and how expertly this image is reflects the counterpoint and harmony between the characters. Both substances give life in moderation and destroy it in excess. Just as his characters are neither truly good nor evil, merely caught up in a twist of fate. A song of Ice and fire.        ;"

Surely it would be better to number them in order (1-5) as you go along.;Overall Grade: 4.5The Grimm Brothers: Growth and Fertility Many themes are presented throughout the Grimm Brothers tales. Coming  of age is one, where transitions of womanhood and the beginnings of  fertility are represented. With this comes loss of innocence and leaving  behind childhood. In the tale of Rapunzel, the fertility theme is presented  early, with Rapunzel   s mother longing to eat salads of rampion. When the  King   s son climbs through the window, Rapunzel is shocked as she comes  face-to-face with the first man she has ever laid eyes upon. Her coming  of age occurs when she accepts his hand in marriage, thus becoming his  wife and the bearer of his children. With Aschenputtel,  fertility is represented by the lentils that she must pick up. She is no  longer a child when the King   s son recognises her as his partner and  takes her for his wife. Sleeping Beauty dives deeper into the state of fertility,  with Rosamund pricking her finger. The blood from this is a symbol of  the medieval belief that a child becomes a woman when she begins  menstruation. In addition, Rosamund falls asleep as a child and wakes up  as a woman. The thorns surrounding the castle are an icon of growth and  serve as a cocoon until the 100 year curse is complete. Similar to this  is the tale of Snow White, where she falls asleep as a na  ve  child and wakes as a learned woman. In this example, the reader is made  aware early on of Snow White   s coming of age, as she becomes fairest of  all. The ripened apple acts as the symbol of fertility. The coming of age and happiness of these women depends upon their  attachments to a male and their social acculturation. This theme is  constant throughout these tales up until the end, where they cannot  remain or return home to their states as children.Works Cited: Rapunzel; Aschenputtel; Sleeping Beauty; Snow White - Grimm - Children's and Household Tales (Lucy Crane translation).FORM = 2peer 2      This student's grammar and punctuation are very good. Furthermore, the  student makes good use of the short word count by being direct and  concise. The only thing that could be improved is the thesis statement.  There is really no need to say that many themes are represented in  Grimm's tales because that's a given. Starting off with the same  directness as the rest of the essay would be beneficial. peer 3     the argument is very well written.peer 4      Form is very clear here, the argument is well laid out and the opening  statement is concise and relevant. Everything seemed carefully planned  and thought through.CONTENT = 2.5peer 1     The main thesis of ""fertility"", ""coming of age"" and ""loss of innocence"" etc. is excellent! peer 2      This student makes good observations about salient themes on the text.  However, because of the limited word count, it might have been  beneficial to concentrate on just one or two stories and add more  details about those.peer 4      1- The chosen topic is interesting, I like how you've explained the  blood or the apple as being symbols/metaphors.  2- If there is one thing I would mention, it would be that even though  your readers will most likely know what your referring to in this case,  some explanation might help, for instance why some symbols are  considered a sign of fertility. Or even how ""the fertility theme is  presented early, with Rapunzel   s mother longing to eat salads of  rampion."" maybe something as simple as (craving) would have explained  it.;Nope.

Often times, the ""heroine"" wins the day by being kind, sweet, but most importantly, beautiful, and that's about it. However, when I read these stories, I have a mindset that they are more like morality tales, almost like Aesop's Fables. No, they don't always have a moral at the end, but I can imagine parents telling their kids these tales to help teach them lessons to ""be good or else.""  That being said, I did enjoy some of them, including ""The Twelve Brothers, Robber Bridegroom, and The Fisherman and his Wife.""

Thanks.;I think the genre ""fairy tale"" contains various sub-genres.   Some of the Grimms' stories are definitely morality tales, in which the good are rewarded (usually after persevering through some trial) and the wicked are punished.   But others belong to the folk hero genre, or maybe the trickster genre, like Tom Thumb, where the hero wins through cleverness and trickery.

At first, the changes are unpredictable, but after she has both sides of the mushroom, she is able to control and fine-tune her size for the later encounters.Very generally, the four settings are human size, small size (with small animals), tiny size (with the caterpillar), and large size. And this made me think of the races in Grimm's fairy tales: humans, dwarves, elves, and giants. If Grimm's folktales draw distinctions between peoples of different sizes with different names, what does it mean when a little girl can move from one size to another freely -- skipping across the borders between the mundane world and the fantastic world, with as little effort as the bite of a mushroom? (Food = knowledge?

However, it never crossed my mind for a second that anything that happened within the pages was true. Certainly, if I had been under the impression that Grimm's fairy tales were a true history of actual events, I would be disturbed.The description of events was not very graphic, or visual. I find horror and slasher films to be much more traumatizing, which is why I choose not to watch them.Also, I understand that violent actions may be a symbol for something else. I imagine if a friend told me that they had a dream where they chopped my head off, I would be disturbed at first, but then I would say to myself, ""I don't think my friend  actually wants to chop my head off. I think it is symbolic of something else."" The imagery in folk tales is very dream-like, and should be read as such.That said, I understand how you feel. Often, when I listen to the news, I feel overwhelmed with all the terrible things that are happening in the world. Sometimes, I need to take a break from the news for a while. So I do, for a few days. Then I come back to it. It is more important to me to feel informed than to feel undisturbed, but I still need a break sometimes.I was once told, ""sensitivity  is a strength, too much sensitivity is a weakness."" I find this to be true.This is a free class, and you will lose nothing by choosing not to participate, other than the experience of the class. If you find that you cannot process the content, maybe this is not the right class for you. If it very important to you to take the class, maybe you can sign up for a future session when you are feeling a little more resilient. You can decide what is best for you. I personally hope you decide to stay with the class, because I want there to be the greatest diversity of perspectives in the forums as possible, but you know what is the best choice for you.;"

If Dr. Frankenstein had made a beautiful creature, or even one that looked like a normal human being, do you think the creature would have been treated the way he was?In all my readings in biology and anthropology, whenever the question of ""is such-and-such behavior genetically or environmentally determined"" is raised, it seems to me that the answer I find most probable is always ""Both factors interact."";Keep in mind that the ""cultivated"" creature was not initially that way -- the creature describes a time when he could not even distinguish his different senses, nor could he understand the spoken word. He begins as brutish and then transforms into a more well-spoken individual. (As a side note: Dr. Frankenstein has the opposite transformation: a young man of learning transforms, through grief, self-loathing, and misery, into a madman) The creature initially seems to be ""frustrated by its limitations,"" as you put it, and I assume it was from this early stage that the movie portrait was drawn. I think each version is well suited to its medium. In literature, well-spoken characters can more easily make their case, especially when dealing with complex subjects such as these, because the medium of literature is composed of words. Film, being a visual medium, can transmit a different sort of message, through the performances of the actors and other visuals, and therefore verbosity is not necessarily  required to convey the same ideas.;"

The confusion remains because most of the Utopian and Dystopian novels are mainstream literature while most of the fantasy and sci-fiction novels are regarded as non-mainstream literature. The truth is, some fantasy and science fiction novels were categorized as popular literature at the time they firstly published and then turned out to be influential, far-reaching and insightful. As time goes by, they became classic. So may be the definition of Utopian and Dystopian does not parallel with the definition of fantasy and sci-fiction. They cross sometimes.  ;"

Yes, he created something beautiful and perfect in his own eyes, but  his terrible flaw is that he is simply blind to everything beyond himself. If he had been able to broaden his perspective even a little bit (""compromise"" is NOT a bad word), he could have had both the butterfly and the family. Instead, his singlemindedness cost him everything of real value. I've known a lot of artists over the years, and the more Owen-ish they are in this regard, the more misery they experience and inflict on those who love them.

Honestly I tend to take things at face value.   I think these are stories told simply to be stories.   When a child asks a parent to tell them a bedtime story it is not  necessarily  wrought with symbolism(though some parents may have ulterior motives behind their stories) but sometimes just pure fantasy.   If and when there is symbolism to be found I think it is a  subconscious  factor.   The number of three comes up in many cultures, offhand I am reminded of the three trials Hercules went through and there would not have been Christian symbolism in that.   On the other hand this is a collection of stories from Germany in the 1800's many of which probably date back to the Dark Ages.   I would not be surprised if there are stories the church helped doctor to make almost modern day parables.;I just wrote my paper on deception in these tales and totally forgot about Grethel.
