pos,"forget about one oscar nomination for julianne moore this year - she should get all five . "
pos,"a film of delicate interpersonal dances . caine makes us watch as his character awakens to the notion that to be human is eventually to have to choose . it's a sight to behold . "
pos,"[cuarón has] created a substantive movie out of several cliched movie structures : the road movie , the coming-of-age movie , and the teenage sex comedy . "
neg,"the boys' sparring , like the succession of blows dumped on guei , wears down the story's more cerebral , and likable , plot elements . "
pos,"a dreadful day in irish history is given passionate , if somewhat flawed , treatment . "
neg,"the respective charms of sandra bullock and hugh grant have worn threadbare . "
neg,"this version of h . g . wells' time machine was directed by h . g . wells' great-grandson . they should have found orson welles' great-grandson . "
pos,"if this story must be told and retold -- and indeed it must -- then the grey zone is to be lauded for finding a new and ingenious angle . "
pos,"not only is it a charming , funny and beautifully crafted import , it uses very little dialogue , making it relatively effortless to read and follow the action at the same time . "
neg,"fairly successful at faking some pretty cool stunts but a complete failure at trying to create some pretty cool characters . and forget about any attempt at a plot ! "
pos,"old people will love this movie , and i mean that in the nicest possible way : last orders will touch the heart of anyone old enough to have earned a 50-year friendship . "
pos,"much credit must be given to the water-camera operating team of don king , sonny miller , and michael stewart . their work is fantastic . "
pos,"the story wraps back around on itself in the kind of elegant symmetry that's rare in film today , but be warned : it's a slow slog to get there . "
neg,"howard conjures the past via surrealist flourishes so overwrought you'd swear he just stepped out of a buñuel retrospective . "
pos,"  red dragon  is entertaining . an obvious copy of one of the best films ever made , how could it not be ? but it is entertaining on an inferior level . it is a popcorn film , not a must-own , or even a must-see . "
neg,"as spent screen series go , star trek : nemesis is even more suggestive of a 65th class reunion mixer where only eight surviving members show up -- and there's nothing to drink . "
neg,"sluggish , tonally uneven . "
neg,"lacks heart , depth and , most of all , purpose . "
neg,"it's just plain lurid when it isn't downright silly . "

neg,"the milieu is wholly unconvincing . . . and the histrionics reach a truly annoying pitch . "
pos,"you'd have to be a most hard-hearted person not to be moved by this drama . "
neg,"it's just hard to believe that a life like this can sound so dull . "
pos,"now as a former gong show addict , i'll admit it , my only complaint is that we didn't get more re-creations of all those famous moments from the show . "
neg,"a hit- and-miss affair , consistently amusing but not as outrageous or funny as cho may have intended or as imaginative as one might have hoped . "

neg,"muddled , simplistic and more than a little pretentious . "
pos,"a film that begins with the everyday lives of naval personnel in san diego and ends with scenes so true and heartbreaking that tears welled up in my eyes both times i saw the film . "

pos,"it's a terrific american sports movie and dennis quaid is its athletic heart . "
neg,"it's a bad action movie because there's no rooting interest and the spectacle is grotesque and boring . "
pos,"the directing and story are disjointed , flaws that have to be laid squarely on taylor's doorstep . but the actors make this worth a peek . "
neg,"more precious than perspicacious"
pos,"it's a hoot watching the rock chomp on jumbo ants , pull an arrow out of his back , and leap unscathed through raging fire ! "
neg,"for those for whom the name woody allen was once a guarantee of something fresh , sometimes funny , and usually genuinely worthwhile , hollywood ending is a depressing experience"
pos,"while somewhat less than it might have been , the film is a good one , and you've got to hand it to director george clooney for biting off such a big job the first time out . "

neg,"the film seems all but destined to pop up on a television screen in the background of a scene in a future quentin tarantino picture"
pos,"[broomfield] uncovers a story powerful enough to leave the screen sizzling with intrigue . "
neg,"those 24-and-unders looking for their own caddyshack to adopt as a generational signpost may have to keep on looking . "
pos,"a whole lot foul , freaky and funny . "
pos,"in the end there is one word that best describes this film : honest . "

neg,"brisk hack job . "
pos,"witless but watchable . "
neg,"[plays] in broad outline as pandering middle-age buddy-comedy . "
neg,"master of disguise runs for only 71 minutes and feels like three hours . "
neg," . . . irritating soul-searching garbage . "
neg,"if the idea of the white man arriving on foreign shores to show wary natives the true light is abhorrent to you , the simplistic heaven will quite likely be more like hell . "
neg,"a standard police-oriented drama that , were it not for de niro's participation , would have likely wound up a tnt original . "
neg,"less worrying about covering all the drama in frida's life and more time spent exploring her process of turning pain into art would have made this a superior movie . "
neg,"you see robert de niro singing - and dancing to - west side story show tunes . choose your reaction : a . ) that sure is funny ! b . ) that sure is pathetic ! "
pos,"a sexy , surprising romance . . . idemoto and kim make a gorgeous pair . . . their scenes brim with sexual possibility and emotional danger . "

pos,"good movie . good actress . but if you expect light romantic comedy , good gosh , will you be shocked . "
pos," . . . the plot weaves us into a complex web . "
neg,"an achingly enthralling premise , the film is hindered by uneven dialogue and plot lapses . "

pos,"with we were soldiers , hollywood makes a valiant attempt to tell a story about the vietnam war before the pathology set in . "
neg,"as vulgar as it is banal . "
neg,"so clichéd that , at one point , they literally upset an apple cart . "
neg,"this is rote spookiness , with nary an original idea ( or role , or edit , or score , or anything , really ) in sight , and the whole of the proceedings beg the question 'why ? '"
neg,"a bizarre piece of work , with premise and dialogue at the level of kids' television and plot threads as morose as teen pregnancy , rape and suspected murder"

pos,"if we sometimes need comforting fantasies about mental illness , we also need movies like tim mccann's revolution no . 9 . "
pos,"one from the heart . "

pos,"has far more energy , wit and warmth than should be expected from any movie with a  2  at the end of its title . "
pos,"engagingly captures the maddening and magnetic ebb and flow of friendship . "
neg,"ben affleck as jack ryan , tom clancy's intrepid hero ? ridiculous . what's next ? d . j . qualls as indiana jones ? or tom green as han solo ? "

pos,"it's a lovely , eerie film that casts an odd , rapt spell . "
pos,"noyce has worked wonders with the material . "
pos,"while most films these days are about nothing , this film seems to be about everything that's plaguing the human spirit in a relentlessly globalizing world . "
pos," . . . a spoof comedy that carries its share of laughs  sometimes a chuckle , sometimes a guffaw and , to my great pleasure , the occasional belly laugh . "

pos,"p . t . anderson understands the grandness of romance and how love is the great equalizer that can calm us of our daily ills and bring out joys in our lives that we never knew were possible . "
neg,"a 93-minute condensation of a 26-episode tv series , with all of the pitfalls of such you'd expect . "
neg,"the action here is unusually tame , the characters are too simplistic to maintain interest , and the plot offers few surprises . "
pos,"star/producer salma hayek and director julie taymor have infused frida with a visual style unique and inherent to the titular character's paintings and in the process created a masterful work of art of their own . "
pos,"a lot smarter than your average bond . "
neg,"the film doesn't show enough of the creative process or even of what was created for the non-fan to figure out what makes wilco a big deal . "
pos,"though only 60 minutes long , the film is packed with information and impressions . "
neg,"even with its $50-million us budget , pinocchio never quite achieves the feel of a fanciful motion picture . "
neg,"with generic sets and b-grade special effects , jason is about as convincing on the sci-fi front as tv's defunct cleopatra 2525 . "

pos,"[barry] gives assassin a disquieting authority . "
neg,"the acting is amateurish , the cinematography is atrocious , the direction is clumsy , the writing is insipid and the violence is at once luridly graphic and laughably unconvincing . "
neg,"fails to convince the audience that these brats will ever be anything more than losers . "
neg,"a big meal of cliches that the talented cast generally chokes on . "
neg,"yes , i have given this movie a rating of zero . but fans of the show should not consider this a diss . consider it 'perfection . '"
neg,"there's a delightfully quirky movie to be made from curling , but brooms isn't it . "
pos,"a gracious , eloquent film that by its end offers a ray of hope to the refugees able to look ahead and resist living in a past forever lost . "
pos,"together , tok and o orchestrate a buoyant , darkly funny dance of death . in the process , they demonstrate that there's still a lot of life in hong kong cinema . "
pos,"  antwone fisher  is an earnest , by-the-numbers effort by washington . it won't rock any boats but is solid meat-and-potatoes filmmaking . "
neg,"the actors improvise and scream their way around this movie directionless , lacking any of the rollicking dark humor so necessary to make this kind of idea work on screen . "
neg,"like a soft drink that's been sitting open too long : it's too much syrup and not enough fizz . "
pos,"the tone is balanced , reflective and reasonable . "
pos,"a delightful little film that revels in its own simplicity , mostly martha will leave you with a smile on your face and a grumble in your stomach . "
pos,"guaranteed to move anyone who ever shook , rattled , or rolled . "
neg,"like a medium-grade network sitcom--mostly inoffensive , fitfully amusing , but ultimately so weightless that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen . "
pos,"whatever heartwarming scene the impressively discreet filmmakers may have expected to record with their mini dv , they show a remarkable ability to document both sides of this emotional car-wreck . "

pos,"it arrives with an impeccable pedigree , mongrel pep , and almost indecipherable plot complications . "

neg,"sometimes this modest little number clicks , and sometimes it doesn't . "
neg,"it's just weirdness for the sake of weirdness , and where human nature should be ingratiating , it's just grating . "
pos,"if ayurveda can help us return to a sane regimen of eating , sleeping and stress-reducing contemplation , it is clearly a good thing . "
neg,"entertains not so much because of its music or comic antics , but through the perverse pleasure of watching disney scrape the bottom of its own cracker barrel . "
neg,"an already thin story boils down to surviving invaders seeking an existent anti-virus . if only there were one for this kind of movie . "
neg,"uneven performances and a spotty script add up to a biting satire that has no teeth . "
pos,"it is a testament of quiet endurance , of common concern , of reconciled survival . "
pos,"a highly intriguing thriller , coupled with some ingenious plot devices and some lavishly built settings . . it's a worthwhile tutorial in quantum physics and slash-dash"
neg,"call me a cold-hearted curmudgeon for not being able to enjoy a mindless action movie , but i believe a movie can be mindless without being the peak of all things insipid . "
pos,"an impressive if flawed effort that indicates real talent . "
pos,"flamboyant in some movies and artfully restrained in others , 65-year-old jack nicholson could be looking at his 12th oscar nomination by proving that he's now , more than ever , choosing his roles with the precision of the insurance actuary . "
neg,"throughout all the tumult , a question comes to mind : so why is this so boring ? "
pos,"murder by numbers' isn't a great movie , but it's a perfectly acceptable widget . "
neg," . . . an hour-and-a-half of inoffensive , unmemorable filler . "
neg,"going to the website may be just as fun ( and scary ) as going to the film . "
pos,"the best didacticism is one carried by a strong sense of humanism , and bertrand tavernier's oft-brilliant safe conduct (  laissez-passer  ) wears its heart on its sleeve . "
pos,"one of the most exciting action films to come out of china in recent years . "
pos,"this one is not nearly as dreadful as expected . in fact , it's quite fun in places . "
neg,"blue crush has all the trappings of an energetic , extreme-sports adventure , but ends up more of a creaky  pretty woman  retread , with the emphasis on self-empowering schmaltz and big-wave surfing that gives pic its title an afterthought . "
neg,"sucking all the 'classic' out of robert louis stevenson's treasure island and filling the void with sci-fi video game graphics and disney-fied adolescent angst . . . "
neg,"with a tone as variable as the cinematography , schaeffer's film never settles into the light-footed enchantment the material needs , and the characters' quirks and foibles never jell into charm . "
neg,"it kinda works and qualifies as cool at times , but is just too lame to work or be cool at others . "
pos,"rarely , indeed almost never , is such high-wattage brainpower coupled with pitch-perfect acting and an exquisite , unfakable sense of cinema . "
pos,"as bundy , michael reilly burke ( octopus 2 : river of fear ) has just the right amount of charisma and menace . "
neg,"what can one say about a balding 50-year-old actor playing an innocent boy carved from a log ? "
neg,"the film equivalent of a toy chest whose contents get scattered over the course of 80 minutes . "
neg,"if there was any doubt that peter o'fallon didn't have an original bone in his body , a rumor of angels should dispel it . "
pos,"worth watching for dong jie's performance -- and for the way it documents a culture in the throes of rapid change . "
neg,"flounders due to the general sense that no two people working on the production had exactly the same thing in mind . "
pos,"more than anything else , kissing jessica stein injects freshness and spirit into the romantic comedy genre , which has been held hostage by generic scripts that seek to remake sleepless in seattle again and again . "
pos,"the invincible werner herzog is alive and well and living in la"
pos,"a droll , well-acted , character-driven comedy with unexpected deposits of feeling . "
neg,"oversexed , at times overwrought comedy/drama that offers little insight into the experience of being forty , female and single . "
pos,"rubbo runs through a remarkable amount of material in the film's short 90 minutes . "
pos,"  home movie  is a sweet treasure and something well worth your time . "
pos,"as simple and innocent a movie as you can imagine . this is a movie you can trust . "
neg,"wimps out by going for that pg-13 rating , so the more graphic violence is mostly off-screen and the sexuality is muted . "
neg,"not only is it hokey , manipulative and as bland as wonder bread dipped in milk , but it also does the absolute last thing we need hollywood doing to us : it preaches . "
neg,"mildly amusing . "
pos,"if you can get past the taboo subject matter , it will be well worth your time . "
neg,"it isn't that stealing harvard is a horrible movieif only it were that grand a failure ! it's just that it's so not-at-all-good . and i expect much more from a talent as outstanding as director bruce mcculloch . "

pos,"finely crafted , finely written , exquisitely performed"
pos,"a strangely compelling and brilliantly acted psychological drama . "
neg,"a serious movie with serious ideas . but seriously , folks , it doesn't work . "
pos,"a live-wire film that never loses its ability to shock and amaze . "
neg,"an unsuccessful attempt at a movie of ideas . "
neg,"amidst the action , the script carries arnold ( and the viewers ) into the forbidden zone of sympathizing with terrorist motivations by presenting the  other side of the story .  "
pos,"in the end , the film is less the cheap thriller you'd expect than it is a fairly revealing study of its two main characters  damaged-goods people whose orbits will inevitably and dangerously collide . "
pos,"the wild thornberrys movie has all the sibling rivalry and general family chaos to which anyone can relate . "
pos,"the film tunes into a grief that could lead a man across centuries . "
pos,"while undisputed isn't exactly a high , it is a gripping , tidy little movie that takes mr . hill higher than he's been in a while . "
neg,"its and pieces of the hot chick are so hilarious , and schneider's performance is so fine , it's a real shame that so much of the movie -- again , as in the animal -- is a slapdash mess . "
neg," . . . would be a total loss if not for two supporting performances taking place at the movie's edges . "
pos,"has an unmistakable , easy joie de vivre . "
neg,"it virtually defines a comedy that's strongly mediocre , with funny bits surfacing every once in a while . "
neg,"without the dark spookiness of crystal lake camp , the horror concept completely loses its creepy menace . "
neg,"has a long and clunky ending . . . which forces the audience to fidget through ten pseudo-serious minutes while waiting for the ending credits and the deleted scenes montage to break the audience's awkward silence"
neg,"no amount of burning , blasting , stabbing , and shooting can hide a weak script . "
neg,"sc2 is an autopilot hollywood concoction lacking in imagination and authentic christmas spirit , yet it's geared toward an audience full of masters of both . "
neg,"the film has the thrown-together feel of a summer-camp talent show : hastily written , underrehearsed , arbitrarily plotted and filled with crude humor and vulgar innuendo . "
pos,"don't wait to see this terrific film with your kids -- if you don't have kids borrow some . "
pos,"with a cast that includes some of the top actors working in independent film , lovely & amazing involves us because it is so incisive , so bleakly amusing about how we go about our lives . "
pos,"as improbable as this premise may seem , abbass's understated , shining performance offers us the sense that on some elemental level , lilia deeply wants to break free of her old life . "
neg,"his comedy premises are often hackneyed or just plain crude , calculated to provoke shocked laughter , without following up on a deeper level . "

pos,"[it's] a clever thriller with enough unexpected twists to keep our interest . "
neg,"as is often the case with ambitious , eager first-time filmmakers , mr . murray , a prolific director of music videos , stuffs his debut with more plot than it can comfortably hold . "
pos,"vereté has a whip-smart sense of narrative bluffs . "
neg,"helmer devito . . . attempts to do too many things in this story about ethics , payola , vice , murder , kids' tv and revenge . "
pos,"even if it pushes its agenda too forcefully , this remains a film about something , one that attempts and often achieves a level of connection and concern . "
neg,"mckay seems embarrassed by his own invention and tries to rush through the intermediary passages , apparently hoping that the audience will not notice the glaring triteness of the plot device he has put in service . "
pos,"the movie is saved from unbearable lightness by the simplicity of the storytelling and the authenticity of the performances . "
pos,"i admired it , particularly that unexpected downer of an ending . "
pos,"on the surface , it's a lovers-on-the-run crime flick , but it has a lot in common with piesiewicz's and kieslowski's earlier work , films like the double life of veronique . "

pos,"miyazaki is one of world cinema's most wondrously gifted artists and storytellers . "
pos,"it's a lovely film with lovely performances by buy and accorsi . "
pos,"what a concept , what an idea , what a thrill ride . this is a more fascinating look at the future than  bladerunner  and one of the most high-concept sci fi adventures attempted for the screen . "
pos,"the philosophical musings of the dialogue jar against the tawdry soap opera antics of the film's action in a way that is surprisingly enjoyable . "
neg,"[seagal's] strenuous attempt at a change in expression could very well clinch him this year's razzie . "
pos,"blanchett's performance confirms her power once again . "
pos,"not about scares but a mood in which an ominous , pervasive , and unknown threat lurks just below the proceedings and adds an almost constant mindset of suspense . "
pos,"the film feels uncomfortably real , its language and locations bearing the unmistakable stamp of authority . "
pos,"none of his actors stand out , but that's less of a problem here than it would be in another film : characterization matters less than atmosphere . "
neg,"the three leads produce adequate performances , but what's missing from this material is any depth of feeling . "
pos,"just about the surest bet for an all-around good time at the movies this summer . "
neg,"the movie has very little to offer besides unintentional laughs . "
pos,"peter jackson and company once again dazzle and delight us , fulfilling practically every expectation either a longtime tolkien fan or a movie-going neophyte could want . "

neg,"demands too much of most viewers . "
neg,"if this is the resurrection of the halloween franchise , it would have been better off dead . "

pos,"bound to appeal to women looking for a howlingly trashy time . "
pos,"without resorting to hyperbole , i can state that kissing jessica stein may be the best same-sex romance i have seen . "
pos,"for most of its footage , the new thriller proves that director m . night shyamalan can weave an eerie spell and that mel gibson can gasp , shudder and even tremble without losing his machismo . "
neg,"earnest yet curiously tepid and choppy recycling in which predictability is the only winner . "
neg,"shouldn't have been allowed to use the word  new  in its title , because there's not an original character , siuation or joke in the entire movie . "

neg,"predictably soulless techno-tripe . "
pos,"films about loss , grief and recovery are pretty valuable these days . seen in that light , moonlight mile should strike a nerve in many . "
pos,"family fare . "
neg,"it becomes gimmicky instead of compelling .  interview  loses its overall sense of mystery and becomes a tv episode rather than a documentary that you actually buy into . "
neg,"these characters become wearisome . "
pos,"about a manga-like heroine who fights back at her abusers , it's energetic and satisfying if not deep and psychological . "
pos,"skin of man gets a few cheap shocks from its kids-in-peril theatrics , but it also taps into the primal fears of young people trying to cope with the mysterious and brutal nature of adults . "
neg,"its plot and animation offer daytime tv serviceability , but little more . "
pos,"though writer/director bart freundlich's film ultimately becomes a simplistic story about a dysfunctional parent-child relationship , it has some special qualities and the soulful gravity of crudup's anchoring performance . "
pos,"the script is smart and dark - hallelujah for small favors . "
neg,"thoroughly awful . "
neg,"the x potion gives the quickly named blossom , bubbles and buttercup supernatural powers that include extraordinary strength and laser-beam eyes , which unfortunately don't enable them to discern flimsy screenplays . "
pos," . . . spellbinding fun and deliciously exploitative . "
pos,"a study in shades of gray , offering itself up in subtle plot maneuvers . . . "
neg,"kitschy , flashy , overlong soap opera . "
neg,"though excessively tiresome , the uncertainty principle , as verbally pretentious as the title may be , has its handful of redeeming features , as long as you discount its ability to bore . "
neg,"the camera whirls ! the camera twirls ! oh , look at that clever angle ! wow , a jump cut ! "
neg,"rosenthal ( halloween ii ) seems to have forgotten everything he ever knew about generating suspense . "
neg,"only two-fifths of a satisfying movie experience . "
pos,"a real winner -- smart , funny , subtle , and resonant . "
pos,"it's truly awful and heartbreaking subject matter , but one whose lessons are well worth revisiting as many times as possible . "
neg,"not an objectionable or dull film ; it merely lacks everything except good intentions . "
neg,"i've seen some bad singer-turned actors , but lil bow wow takes the cake . "
pos,"it dares to be a little different , and that shading is what makes it worthwhile . "
neg,"a ragbag of cliches . "
neg,"as earnest as a community-college advertisement , american chai is enough to make you put away the guitar , sell the amp , and apply to medical school . "
neg,"if damon and affleck attempt another project greenlight , next time out they might try paying less attention to the miniseries and more attention to the film it is about . "
neg,"short and sweet , but also more than anything else slight tadpole pulls back from the consequences of its own actions and revelations . "
neg,"it doesn't quite deserve the gong , but there are more fascinating acts than  confessions of a dangerous mind .  "
pos,"the simplicity of the way home has few equals this side of aesop"
neg,"it all seemed wasted like deniro's once promising career and the once grand long beach boardwalk . "
neg,"godard uses his characters -- if that's not too glorified a term -- as art things , mouthpieces , visual motifs , blanks . "
neg,"van wilder brings a whole new meaning to the phrase 'comedy gag . ' at least one scene is so disgusting that viewers may be hard pressed to retain their lunch . "
pos,"a decent-enough nail-biter that stands a good chance of being the big hit franklin needs to stay afloat in hollywood . "
neg,"how can such a cold movie claim to express warmth and longing ? in truth , it has all the heart of a porno flick ( but none of the sheer lust ) . "
pos,"left me with the visceral sensation of longing , lasting traces of charlotte's web of desire and desperation . "
neg,"i was perplexed to watch it unfold with an astonishing lack of passion or uniqueness . "
pos,"the socio-histo-political treatise is told in earnest strides . . . [and] personal illusion is deconstructed with poignancy . "
neg,"some of the computer animation is handsome , and various amusing sidekicks add much-needed levity to the otherwise bleak tale , but overall the film never rises above mediocrity . "
neg,"britney's performance cannot be faulted . lucy's a dull girl , that's all . "
neg,"a dark , dull thriller with a parting shot that misfires . "
pos,"a small gem from belgium . "
pos,"with so many bad romances out there , this is the kind of movie that deserves a chance to shine . "
neg,"the cold turkey would've been a far better title . "
pos,"i won't argue with anyone who calls 'slackers' dumb , insulting , or childish . . . but i laughed so much that i didn't mind . "
pos,"the film offers an intriguing what-if premise . "
neg,"a clash between the artificial structure of the story and the more contemporary , naturalistic tone of the film . . . "
pos,"a graceful , moving tribute to the courage of new york's finest and a nicely understated expression of the grief shared by the nation at their sacrifice . "
neg,"a bad movie that happened to good actors . "
pos,"like vardalos and corbett , who play their roles with vibrant charm , the film , directed by joel zwick , is heartfelt and hilarious in ways you can't fake . "
neg,"gooding and coburn are both oscar winners , a fact which , as you watch them clumsily mugging their way through snow dogs , seems inconceivable . "
neg,"nothing more or less than an outright bodice-ripper -- it should have ditched the artsy pretensions and revelled in the entertaining shallows . "
pos,"instead of hitting the audience over the head with a moral , schrader relies on subtle ironies and visual devices to convey point of view . "
neg,"it's lazy for a movie to avoid solving one problem by trying to distract us with the solution to another . "
pos,"if you're in the right b-movie frame of mind , it may just scare the pants off you . "
pos,"devos and cassel have tremendous chemistry -- their sexual and romantic tension , while never really vocalized , is palpable . "
neg,"who are 'they' ? well , they're 'they' . they're the unnamed , easily substitutable forces that serve as whatever terror the heroes of horror movies try to avoid . they exist for hushed lines like  they're back !  ,  they're out there !  and  they're coming !  "
pos,"the drama is played out with such aching beauty and truth that it brings tears to your eyes . "
pos,"while there are times when the film's reach exceeds its grasp , the production works more often than it doesn't . "
neg,"the plot plummets into a comedy graveyard before janice comes racing to the rescue in the final reel . "
neg,"it's supposed to be post-feminist breezy but ends up as tedious as the chatter of parrots raised on oprah . "
neg,"so-so entertainment . "
pos,"colorful and deceptively buoyant until it suddenly pulls the rug out from under you , burkinabe filmmaker dani kouyate's reworking of a folk story whose roots go back to 7th-century oral traditions is also a pointed political allegory . "
neg,"though there's a clarity of purpose and even-handedness to the film's direction , the drama feels rigged and sluggish . "
pos,"to those who have not read the book , the film is a much better mother-daughter tale than last summer's 'divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood , ' but that's not saying much . "
neg,"sandra bullock , despite downplaying her good looks , carries a little too much ain't- she-cute baggage into her lead role as a troubled and determined homicide cop to quite pull off the heavy stuff . "
neg,"most of the movie is so deadly dull that watching the proverbial paint dry would be a welcome improvement . "
neg,"i didn't find much fascination in the swinging . what they're doing is a matter of plumbing arrangements and mind games , of no erotic or sensuous charge . but that they are doing it is thought-provoking . "
pos,"a touching drama about old age and grief with a tour de force performance by michel piccoli . "
pos,"just about the best straight-up , old-school horror film of the last 15 years . "
neg,"while the script starts promisingly , it loses steam towards the middle and never really develops beyond attacking obvious target . "
neg,"not always too whimsical for its own good ( but enough to do harm ) , this strange hybrid of crime thriller , quirky character study , third-rate romance and female empowerment fantasy never really finds the tonal or thematic glue it needs . "
pos,"viewers of  the ring  are more likely to remember the haunting images than the plot holes . "
pos,"deliciously slow . "
pos,"a powerful , chilling , and affecting study of one man's dying fall . "
pos," . . . a sweetly affecting story about four sisters who are coping , in one way or another , with life's endgame . "
pos,"cantet beautifully illuminates what it means sometimes to be inside looking out , and at other times outside looking in . "
pos,"return to never land is reliable , standard disney animated fare , with enough creative energy and wit to entertain all ages . "
pos,"while not all that bad of a movie , it's nowhere near as good as the original . "
neg,"it's like an all-star salute to disney's cheesy commercialism . "
neg,"the film's darker moments become smoothed over by an overwhelming need to tender inspirational tidings , especially in the last few cloying moments . "
neg,"what's next ? rob schneider , dana carvey and sarah michelle gellar in the philadelphia story ? david spade as citizen kane ? "
pos,"if you love reading and/or poetry , then by all means check it out . you'll probably love it . "
neg,"credibility levels are low and character development a non-starter . "
neg,"i'd have to say the star and director are the big problems here . "
pos,"[fessenden] is much more into ambiguity and creating mood than he is for on screen thrills"
pos,"a literate presentation that wonderfully weaves a murderous event in 1873 with murderous rage in 2002 . "
neg,"when you resurrect a dead man , hard copy should come a-knocking , no ? "
neg,"just dreadful . i don't blame eddie murphy but shouldn't owen wilson know a movie must have a story and a script ? "
pos,"isn't quite the equal of woo's best earlier work , but it's easily his finest american film . . . comes close to recapturing the brilliance of his hong kong films . "
pos,"were it not for a sentimental resolution that explains way more about cal than does the movie or the character any good , freundlich's world traveler might have been one of the more daring and surprising american movies of the year . "
pos,"wickedly funny , visually engrossing , never boring , this movie challenges us to think about the ways we consume pop culture . "
neg," . . . turns so unforgivably trite in its last 10 minutes that anyone without a fortified sweet tooth will likely go into sugar shock . "
pos,"your children will be occupied for 72 minutes . "
pos,"carrying off a spot-on scottish burr , duvall ( also a producer ) peels layers from this character that may well not have existed on paper . "
neg,"if it's seldom boring , well , it's also rarely coherent . "
neg,"the story is bogus and its characters tissue-thin . "
pos,"transforms one of [shakespeare's] deepest tragedies into a smart new comedy . "
pos,"what time is it there ? is not easy . it haunts you , you can't forget it , you admire its conception and are able to resolve some of the confusions you had while watching it . "
pos,"'barbershop  is a good-hearted ensemble comedy with a variety of quirky characters and an engaging story . "
neg,"we never feel anything for these characters , and as a result the film is basically just a curiosity . "
pos,"terrific casting and solid execution give all three stories life . "
pos,"time out is as serious as a pink slip . and more than that , it's an observant , unfussily poetic meditation about identity and alienation . "
neg,"the good thing -- the only good thing -- about extreme ops is that it's so inane that it gave me plenty of time to ponder my thanksgiving to-do list . "
neg,"this is a movie so insecure about its capacity to excite that it churns up not one but two flagrantly fake thunderstorms to underscore the action . "
pos,"making such a tragedy the backdrop to a love story risks trivializing it , though chouraqui no doubt intended the film to affirm love's power to help people endure almost unimaginable horror . "
pos,"everywhere the camera looks there is something worth seeing . "
pos,"it may not be particularly innovative , but the film's crisp , unaffected style and air of gentle longing make it unexpectedly rewarding . "
neg,"passable enough for a shoot-out in the o . k . court house of life type of flick . strictly middle of the road . "
neg,"silly stuff , all mixed up together like a term paper from a kid who can't quite distinguish one sci-fi work from another . "
pos,"it's a ripper of a yarn and i for one enjoyed the thrill of the chill . naomi watts is terrific as rachel ; her petite frame and vulnerable persona emphasising her plight and isolation . "
neg,"a generic family comedy unlikely to be appreciated by anyone outside the under-10 set . "
pos,"a beautifully observed character piece . "
pos,"it's all a rather shapeless good time . . . "
neg,"beers , who , when she's given the right lines , can charm the paint off the wall . . . [but] the script goes wrong at several key junctures . "
neg,"it's a frightful vanity film that , no doubt , pays off what debt miramax felt they owed to benigni . "
neg,"there's something with potential here , but the movie decides , like lavinia , to go the conservative route . "
neg,"a tired , unimaginative and derivative variation of that already-shallow genre . "
pos,"a searing , epic treatment of a nationwide blight that seems to be , horrifyingly , ever on the rise . "
neg,"you'll trudge out of the theater feeling as though you rode the zipper after eating a corn dog and an extra-large cotton candy . "
pos,"it is definitely worth seeing . "
neg,"neither a rousing success nor a blinding embarrassment . still , it just sits there like a side dish no one ordered . "
neg,"denis o'neill's script avoids the prime sports cliche , a last-second goal to win the championship , but it neglects few others . "
neg,"message movie or an action-packed submarine spectacular ? alas , it's neither . "
neg,"exploitative and largely devoid of the depth or sophistication that would make watching such a graphic treatment of the crimes bearable . "
pos,"charles' entertaining film chronicles seinfeld's return to stand-up comedy after the wrap of his legendary sitcom , alongside wannabe comic adams' attempts to get his shot at the big time . "
neg,"two big things are missing -- anything approaching a visceral kick , and anything approaching even a vague reason to sit through it all . "
pos,"the movie starts with a legend and ends with a story that is so far-fetched it would be impossible to believe if it weren't true . this is the stuff that disney movies are made of . "
neg,"it's a shame that the storyline and its underlying themes . . . finally seem so impersonal or even shallow . "
pos,"a gorgeous , witty , seductive movie . "
pos,"the film's constant mood of melancholy and its unhurried narrative are masterfully controlled . but  in trying to capture the novel's deeper intimate resonances , the film has  ironically - distanced us from the characters . "
pos,"divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood may not be exactly divine , but it's definitely -- defiantly -- ya ya , what with all of those terrific songs and spirited performances . "
neg,"the question hanging over the time machine is not , as the main character suggests , 'what if ? ' but rather , 'how can you charge money for this ? '"
pos,"somewhere short of tremors on the modern b-scene : neither as funny nor as clever , though an agreeably unpretentious way to spend ninety minutes . "
neg,"the script falls back on too many tried-and-true shenanigans that hardly distinguish it from the next teen comedy . "
neg,"the film is so bad it doesn't improve upon the experience of staring at a blank screen . "
pos,"beautifully reclaiming the story of carmen and recreating it an in an african idiom . "
pos,"the film has a terrific look and salma hayek has a feel for the character at all stages of her life . "
neg,"has little on its mind aside from scoring points with drag gags . "
pos,"this is simply the most fun you'll ever have with a documentary ! "
neg,"the script was reportedly rewritten a dozen times -- either 11 times too many or else too few . "
neg,"it's inoffensive , cheerful , built to inspire the young people , set to an unending soundtrack of beach party pop numbers and aside from its remarkable camerawork and awesome scenery , it's about as exciting as a sunburn . "
neg,"not once in the rush to save the day did i become very involved in the proceedings ; to me , it was just a matter of 'eh . '"
neg,"they were afraid to show this movie to reviewers before its opening , afraid of the bad reviews they thought they'd earn . they were right . "
pos,"there's an energy to y tu mamá también . much of it comes from the brave , uninhibited performances by its lead actors . "
pos,"phillip noyce and all of his actors -- as well as his cinematographer , christopher doyle -- understand the delicate forcefulness of greene's prose , and it's there on the screen in their version of the quiet american . "
neg,"there's too much falseness to the second half , and what began as an intriguing look at youth fizzles into a dull , ridiculous attempt at heart-tugging . "
pos,"tadpole is a sophisticated , funny and good-natured treat , slight but a pleasure . "
neg,"it's deep-sixed by a compulsion to catalog every bodily fluids gag in there's something about mary and devise a parallel clone-gag . "
pos,"keenly observed and refreshingly natural , swimming gets the details right , from its promenade of barely clad bodies in myrtle beach , s . c . , to the adrenaline jolt of a sudden lunch rush at the diner . "
neg,"the film's bathos often overwhelms what could have been a more multifaceted look at this interesting time and place . "
pos,"a lovely film for the holiday season . "
neg,"for all its alleged youthful fire , xxx is no less subservient to bond's tired formula of guns , girls and gadgets while brandishing a new action hero . "
neg,"the humor is forced and heavy-handed , and occasionally simply unpleasant . "
neg,"the tone shifts abruptly from tense to celebratory to soppy . "
pos,"just what makes us happy , anyway ? "
neg,"very special effects , brilliantly bold colors and heightened reality can't hide the giant achilles' heel in  stuart little 2  : there's just no story , folks . "
pos,"it's an old story , but a lively script , sharp acting and partially animated interludes make just a kiss seem minty fresh . "
pos,"the cast is uniformly excellent and relaxed . "
neg,"overburdened with complicated plotting and banal dialogue"
pos,"even if you can't pronounce  gyro  correctly , you'll appreciate much of vardalos' humor , which transcends ethnic boundaries . "
pos,"a burst of color , music , and dance that only the most practiced curmudgeon could fail to crack a smile at . "
pos,"the movie does its best to work us over , with second helpings of love , romance , tragedy , false dawns , real dawns , comic relief , two separate crises during marriage ceremonies , and the lush scenery of the cotswolds . "
neg,"an impenetrable and insufferable ball of pseudo-philosophic twaddle . "
pos,"a fanciful drama about napoleon's last years and his surprising discovery of love and humility . "
neg," . . . built on the premise that middle-class arkansas consists of monster truck-loving good ol' boys and peroxide blond honeys whose worldly knowledge comes from tv reruns and supermarket tabloids . "
neg,"as crimes go , writer-director michael kalesniko's how to kill your neighbor's dog is slight but unendurable . "
neg,"each scene drags , underscoring the obvious , and sentiment is slathered on top . "
neg," . . . one resurrection too many . "
pos,"a delectable and intriguing thriller filled with surprises , read my lips is an original . this is a story of two misfits who don't stand a chance alone , but together they are magnificent . "
neg,"a grand fart coming from a director beginning to resemble someone's crazy french grandfather . "
pos,"it seems grant doesn't need the floppy hair and the self-deprecating stammers after all . "
pos,"the wild thornberrys movie is pleasant enough and the message of our close ties with animals can certainly not be emphasized enough . "
neg,"it's an 88-minute highlight reel that's 86 minutes too long . "
neg,"it's another video movie photographed like a film , with the bad lighting that's often written off as indie film naturalism . "
neg,"expect the same-old , lame-old slasher nonsense , just with different scenery . "
pos,"like kubrick , soderbergh isn't afraid to try any genre and to do it his own way . "
pos,"leigh succeeds in delivering a dramatic slap in the face that's simultaneously painful and refreshing . "
pos,"assured , glossy and shot through with brittle desperation . "
neg,"nothing more than an amiable but unfocused bagatelle that plays like a loosely-connected string of acting-workshop exercises . "
neg,"the film never gets over its own investment in conventional arrangements , in terms of love , age , gender , race , and class . "
pos,"all leather pants & augmented boobs , hawn is hilarious as she tries to resuscitate the fun-loving libertine lost somewhere inside the conservative , handbag-clutching sarandon . "
neg,"this hastily mounted production exists only to capitalize on hopkins' inclination to play hannibal lecter again , even though harris has no immediate inclination to provide a fourth book . "
pos,"irwin is so earnest that it's hard to resist his pleas to spare wildlife and respect their environs . there are far worse messages to teach a young audience , which will probably be perfectly happy with the sloppy slapstick comedy . "
pos,"fresnadillo has something serious to say about the ways in which extravagant chance can distort our perspective and throw us off the path of good sense . "
neg,"a mimetic approximation of better films like contempt and 8 1/2 . "
neg,"a solid film . . . but more conscientious than it is truly stirring . "
pos,"it's a work by an artist so in control of both his medium and his message that he can improvise like a jazzman . "
pos,"polanski has found the perfect material with which to address his own world war ii experience in his signature style . "
pos,"there's a spontaneity to the chateau , a sense of light-heartedness , that makes it attractive throughout . "
pos,"this is such a high-energy movie where the drumming and the marching are so excellent , who cares if the story's a little weak . "
neg,"watching it is rather like viewing a long soap opera in which only the first episode was any good . "
pos,"the most compelling wiseman epic of recent years . "
pos,"you won't believe much of it , but you will laugh at the audacity , at the who's who casting and the sheer insanity of it all . "
pos,"it's the kind of pigeonhole-resisting romp that hollywood too rarely provides . "
neg,"snow dogs finds its humour in a black man getting humiliated by a pack of dogs who are smarter than him"
neg,"the criticism never rises above easy , cynical potshots at morally bankrupt characters . . . "
neg,"god is great , the movie's not . "
pos,"a tour de force of modern cinema . "
pos,"it's pretty linear and only makeup-deep , but bogdanovich ties it together with efficiency and an affection for the period . "
neg,"halfway through the movie , the humor dwindles . it's replaced by some dramatic scenes that are jarring and deeply out of place in what could have ( and probably should have ) been a lighthearted comedy . "
pos,"one of those rare films that seems as though it was written for no one , but somehow manages to convince almost everyone that it was put on the screen , just for them . "
pos,"a historical epic with the courage of its convictions about both scope and detail . "
neg,"as predictable as the outcome of a globetrotters-generals game , juwanna mann is even more ludicrous than you'd expect from the guy-in-a-dress genre , and a personal low for everyone involved . "
neg,"although based on a real-life person , john , in the movie , is a rather dull person to be stuck with for two hours . "
neg,"i am sorry that i was unable to get the full brunt of the comedy . "
pos,"secretary manages a neat trick , bundling the flowers of perversity , comedy and romance into a strangely tempting bouquet of a movie . "
neg,"proof that a thriller can be sleekly shot , expertly cast , paced with crisp professionalism . . . and still be a letdown if its twists and turns hold no more surprise than yesterday's weather report . "
pos,"she's all-powerful , a voice for a pop-cyber culture that feeds on her bjorkness . "
neg,"like showgirls and glitter , the most entertaining moments here are unintentional . "
pos,"anchored by a terrific performance by abbass , satin rouge shows that the idea of women's self-actualization knows few continental divides . "
neg,"fancy a real downer ? [leigh] lays it on so thick this time that it feels like a suicide race . "
neg,"in a 102-minute film , aaliyah gets at most 20 minutes of screen time . . . . most viewers will wish there had been more of the  queen  and less of the  damned .  "
pos,"the usual movie rah-rah , pleasantly and predictably delivered in low-key style by director michael apted and writer tom stoppard . "
pos,"overall , it's a wacky and inspired little film that works effortlessly at delivering genuine , acerbic laughs . "
pos,"clint eastwood's blood work is a lot like a well-made pb& j sandwich : familiar , fairly uneventful and boasting no real surprises  but still quite tasty and inviting all the same . "
neg,"the latest adam sandler assault and possibly the worst film of the year . "
neg,"it's absolutely amazing how first-time director kevin donovan managed to find something new to add to the canon of chan . make chan's action sequences boring . "
neg,"for all its brilliant touches , dragon loses its fire midway , nearly flickering out by its perfunctory conclusion . "
pos,"the cast . . . keeps this pretty watchable , and casting mick jagger as director of the escort service was inspired . "
pos," i admire the closing scenes of the film , which seem to ask whether our civilization offers a cure for vincent's complaint . "
neg," . . . the film falls back on the same old formula of teen sex , outrageous pranks and scenes designed to push the envelope of bad taste for laughs . "
pos,"the scorpion king is more fun than conan the barbarian . "
neg,"paxton's uneven directorial debut fails to unlock the full potential of what is in many ways a fresh and dramatically substantial spin on the genre . "
pos,"able to provide insight into a fascinating part of theater history . "
neg,"these spiders can outrun a motorcycle and wrap a person in a sticky cocoon in seconds , but they fall short of being interesting or entertaining . "
neg,"this is junk food cinema at its greasiest . "
pos,"this engrossing , characteristically complex tom clancy thriller is shifty in the manner in which it addresses current terrorism anxieties and sidesteps them at the same time . "
pos,"an extraordinary dramatic experience . "
pos,"poetry in motion captured on film . while it can be a bit repetitive , overall it's an entertaining and informative documentary . "
neg," . . . unbearably lame . "
neg,"mr . deeds is not really a film as much as it is a loose collection of not-so-funny gags , scattered moments of lazy humor . "
neg,"grating and tedious . "
neg,"a family-friendly fantasy that ends up doing very little with its imaginative premise . "
neg,"holds limited appeal to those who like explosions , sadism and seeing people beat each other to a pulp . "
neg,"a movie that feels like the pilot episode of a new teen-targeted action tv series . "
neg,"cox is far more concerned with aggrandizing madness , not the man , and the results might drive you crazy . "
pos,"sure , i hated myself in the morning . but then again , i hate myself most mornings . i still like moonlight mile , better judgment be damned . "
neg,"deep down , i realized the harsh reality of my situation : i would leave the theater with a lower i . q . than when i had entered . "
neg,"given that both movies expect us to root for convicted violent felons over those assigned to protect us from same , we need every bit of sympathy the cons can muster ; this time , there isn't much . "
pos,"if your senses haven't been dulled by slasher films and gorefests , if you're a connoisseur of psychological horror , this is your ticket . "
neg,"some movies can get by without being funny simply by structuring the scenes as if they were jokes : a setup , delivery and payoff . stealing harvard can't even do that much . each scene immediately succumbs to gravity and plummets to earth . "
neg,"the filmmaker ascends , literally , to the olympus of the art world , but he would have done well to end this flawed , dazzling series with the raising of something other than his own cremaster . "
neg,"replacing john carpenter's stylish tracking shots is degraded , handheld blair witch video-cam footage . of all the halloween's , this is the most visually unappealing . "
neg,"a technically well-made suspenser . . . but its abrupt drop in iq points as it races to the finish line proves simply too discouraging to let slide . "
neg,"nonsensical , dull  cyber-horror  flick is a grim , hollow exercise in flat scares and bad acting . "
pos," ( caine ) proves once again he hasn't lost his touch , bringing off a superb performance in an admittedly middling film . "
pos,"it cuts to the core of what it actually means to face your fears , to be a girl in a world of boys , to be a boy truly in love with a girl , and to ride the big metaphorical wave that is life -- wherever it takes you . "
pos,"the tenderness of the piece is still intact . "
neg,"unfortunately , contrived plotting , stereotyped characters and woo's over-the-top instincts as a director undermine the moral dilemma at the movie's heart . "
pos,"a muddle splashed with bloody beauty as vivid as any scorsese has ever given us . "
neg,"so faithful to the doldrums of the not-quite-urban , not-quite-suburban milieu as to have viewers recoiling from the reality check . "
pos,"working from elliott's memoir , rohmer fashions the sort of delicate , articulate character- and- relationship study he's favored for decades . "
neg,"everything is off . "
pos," . . . [the film] works , due mostly to the tongue-in-cheek attitude of the screenplay . "
pos,"audiard successfully maintains suspense on different levels throughout a film that is both gripping and compelling . "
pos,"one of the year's best films , featuring an oscar-worthy performance by julianne moore . "
pos,"even though it is infused with the sensibility of a video director , it doesn't make for completely empty entertainment"
pos,"manages to please its intended audience -- children -- without placing their parents in a coma-like state . "
neg,"decent but dull . "
neg,"yet another weepy southern bore-athon . "
neg,"a moving picture that does not move . "
neg,"it's not nearly as fresh or enjoyable as its predecessor , but there are enough high points to keep this from being a complete waste of time . "
pos,"it's clear that mehta simply wanted to update her beloved genre for the thousands of indians who fancy themselves too sophisticated for the cheese-laced spectacles that pack 'em in on the subcontinent . "
neg,"a film that will probably please people already fascinated by behan but leave everyone else yawning with admiration . "
pos,"4 friends , 2 couples , 2000 miles , and all the pabst blue ribbon beer they can drink - it's the ultimate redneck road-trip . "
neg,"they kept much of the plot but jettisoned the stuff that would make this a moving experience for people who haven't read the book . "
neg,"for every articulate player , such as skateboarder tony hawk or bmx rider mat hoffman , are about a half dozen young turks angling to see how many times they can work the words  radical  or  suck  into a sentence . "
pos,"it is interesting and fun to see goodall and her chimpanzees on the bigger-than-life screen . "
neg,"lurid and less than lucid work . "
pos,"best enjoyed as a work of fiction inspired by real-life events . those seeking a definitive account of eisenstein's life would do better elsewhere . "
neg,"serviceable at best , slightly less than serviceable at worst . "
neg,"whole stretches of the film may be incomprehensible to moviegoers not already clad in basic black . "
neg,"lacking gravitas , macdowell is a placeholder for grief , and ergo this sloppy drama is an empty vessel . leave these flowers unpicked -- they're dead on the vine . "
neg,"video games are more involving than this mess . "
pos,"hatfield and hicks make the oddest of couples , and in this sense the movie becomes a study of the gambles of the publishing world , offering a case study that exists apart from all the movie's political ramifications . "
pos,"on this tricky topic , tadpole is very much a step in the right direction , with its blend of frankness , civility and compassion . "
neg,"a modestly comic , modestly action-oriented world war ii adventure that , in terms of authenticity , is one of those films that requires the enemy to never shoot straight . "
neg,"a little too pat for its own good . "
neg,"just when the movie seems confident enough to handle subtlety , it dives into soapy bathos . "
neg,"will anyone who isn't a fangoria subscriber be excited that it hasn't gone straight to video ? "
pos,"offers much to enjoy . . . and a lot to mull over in terms of love , loyalty and the nature of staying friends . "

neg,"much of the cast is stiff or just plain bad . "
neg,"it's definitely not made for kids or their parents , for that matter , and i think even fans of sandler's comic taste may find it uninteresting . "

pos,"a film of quiet power . "
pos,"this is a story that zings all the way through with originality , humour and pathos . "
neg,"you come away wishing , though , that the movie spent a lot less time trying to make a credible case for reports from the afterlife and a lot more time on the romantic urgency that's at the center of the story . "
pos,"a charming yet poignant tale of the irrevocable ties that bind . "
pos," ( rises ) above its oh-so-hollywood rejiggering and its conventional direction to give the film a soul and an unabashed sense of good old-fashioned escapism . "
neg,"as if drop dead gorgeous wasn't enough , this equally derisive clunker is fixated on the spectacle of small-town competition . "
neg,"the film is all over the place , really . it dabbles all around , never gaining much momentum . "
neg,"if we're to slap protagonist genevieve leplouff because she's french , do we have that same option to slap her creators because they're clueless and inept ? "

neg,"cold , sterile and lacking any color or warmth . "
neg,"the movie , directed by mick jackson , leaves no cliche unturned , from the predictable plot to the characters straight out of central casting . "
neg,"a mawkish self-parody that plays like some weird masterpiece theater sketch with neither a point of view nor a compelling reason for being . "
pos,"exceptionally well acted by diane lane and richard gere . "
pos,"engrossing and affecting , if ultimately not quite satisfying . "
neg,"el crimen del padre amaro would likely be most effective if used as a tool to rally anti-catholic protestors . "
pos,"you may think you have figured out the con and the players in this debut film by argentine director fabian bielinsky , but while you were thinking someone made off with your wallet . "
pos,"like the original , this version is raised a few notches above kiddie fantasy pablum by allen's astringent wit . "
pos,"for almost the first two-thirds of martin scorsese's 168-minute gangs of new york , i was entranced . "
neg,"there are more shots of children smiling for the camera than typical documentary footage which hurts the overall impact of the film . it's makes a better travelogue than movie . "
pos,"a marvel like none you've seen . "
neg,"director hoffman , his writer and kline's agent should serve detention"
pos,"bluer than the atlantic and more biologically detailed than an autopsy , the movie . . . is , also , frequently hilarious . "
neg,"instead of building to a laugh riot we are left with a handful of disparate funny moments of no real consequence . "

pos,"the film's intimate camera work and searing performances pull us deep into the girls' confusion and pain as they struggle tragically to comprehend the chasm of knowledge that's opened between them . "
pos,"hartley adds enough quirky and satirical touches in the screenplay to keep the film entertaining . "
pos,"thought-provoking and stylish , if also somewhat hermetic . "

pos,"haneke challenges us to confront the reality of sexual aberration . "
pos,"one-of-a-kind near-masterpiece . "
pos,"few films capture so perfectly the hopes and dreams of little boys on baseball fields as well as the grown men who sit in the stands . "
neg,"it's a decent glimpse into a time period , and an outcast , that is no longer accessible , but it doesn't necessarily shed more light on its subject than the popular predecessor . "
pos,"the movie should be credited with remembering his victims . "
pos,"takes a fresh and absorbing look at a figure whose legacy had begun to bronze . "
neg,"the sweetest thing leaves a bitter taste . "
neg,"less funny than it should be and less funny than it thinks it is . "

neg,"a restrained ribisi convinces as an italian , though if ever a movie needed one of the actor's whiny jags to pump it up , this has to be among the rare ones . "
neg,"some movies were made for the big screen , some for the small screen , and some , like ballistic : ecks vs . sever , were made for the palm screen . "

pos,"an irresistible combination of a rousing good story set on a truly grand scale . "
pos,"this is not a retread of  dead poets' society .  "
pos,"the transporter is as lively and as fun as it is unapologetically dumb"
neg,"the film boasts at least a few good ideas and features some decent performances , but the result is disappointing . "
neg,"scotland , pa . is a strangely drab romp . some studio pizazz might have helped . "

pos,"the members manage to pronounce kok exactly as you think they might , thus giving the cast ample opportunity to use that term as often as possible . it's very beavis and butthead , yet always seems to elicit a chuckle . "

pos,"griffiths proves she's that rare luminary who continually raises the standard of her profession . "
pos,"a delicious , quirky movie with a terrific screenplay and fanciful direction by michael gondry . "

neg,"if the full monty was a freshman fluke , lucky break is [cattaneo] sophomore slump . "
pos,"ramsay succeeds primarily with her typical blend of unsettling atmospherics , delivering a series of abrasive , stylized sequences that burn themselves upon the viewer's memory . "
pos,"a deeply felt and vividly detailed story about newcomers in a strange new world . "
neg,"because the intelligence level of the characters must be low , very low , very very low , for the masquerade to work , the movie contains no wit , only labored gags . "
neg,"the entire point of a shaggy dog story , of course , is that it goes nowhere , and this is classic nowheresville in every sense . "

pos,"both garcia and jagger turn in perfectly executed and wonderfully sympathetic characters , who are alternately touching and funny . "
pos,"here's yet another studio horror franchise mucking up its storyline with glitches casual fans could correct in their sleep . but taken as a stylish and energetic one-shot , the queen of the damned cannot be said to suck . "
neg,"[soderbergh] tends to place most of the psychological and philosophical material in italics rather than trust an audience's intelligence , and he creates an overall sense of brusqueness . "

pos,"if steven soderbergh's 'solaris' is a failure it is a glorious failure . "
neg,"costner's warm-milk persona is just as ill-fitting as shadyac's perfunctory directing chops , and some of the more overtly silly dialogue would sink laurence olivier . "

pos,"by turns touching , raucously amusing , uncomfortable , and , yes , even sexy , never again is a welcome and heartwarming addition to the romantic comedy genre . "
neg,"maybe it's the star power of the cast or the redundant messages , but something aboul  full frontal  seems , well , contrived . "

neg,"i could just feel the screenwriter at every moment 'tap , tap , tap , tap , tapping away' on this screenplay . "
neg,"apallingly absurd . . . the chemistry or lack thereof between newton and wahlberg could turn an imax theater into a 9  black and white portable tv . "
neg,"the film is so busy making reference to other films and trying to be other films that it fails to have a heart , mind or humor of its own . "

pos,"hashiguchi uses the situation to evoke a japan bustling atop an undercurrent of loneliness and isolation . "
pos,"it's good , hard-edged stuff , violent and a bit exploitative but also nicely done , morally alert and street-smart . "
pos,"narc may not get an 'a' for originality , but it wears its b-movie heritage like a badge of honor . "
neg,"its lack of quality earns it a place alongside those other two recent dumas botch-jobs , the man in the iron mask and the musketeer . "
pos,"director rob marshall went out gunning to make a great one . "
neg,"a listless sci-fi comedy in which eddie murphy deploys two guises and elaborate futuristic sets to no particularly memorable effect . "
pos,"this fascinating experiment plays as more of a poetic than a strict reality , creating an intriguing species of artifice that gives the lady and the duke something of a theatrical air . "
neg,"becomes a bit of a mishmash : a tearjerker that doesn't and a thriller that won't . "
neg,"in the not-too-distant future , movies like ghost ship will be used as analgesic balm for overstimulated minds . right now , they're merely signposts marking the slow , lingering death of imagination . "
pos,"pan nalin's exposition is beautiful and mysterious , and the interviews that follow , with the practitioners of this ancient indian practice , are as subtle and as enigmatic . "
neg,"instead of contriving a climactic hero's death for the beloved-major- character-who-shall- remain-nameless , why not invite some genuine spontaneity into the film by having the evil aliens' laser guns actually hit something for once ? "
pos,"despite modest aspirations its occasional charms are not to be dismissed . "
pos,"it's hard to fairly judge a film like ringu when you've seen the remake first . many of the effective horror elements are dampened through familiarity , [yet] are worthwhile . "
pos,"this is one of polanski's best films . "

neg,"undercover brother doesn't go far enough . it's just a silly black genre spoof . "
pos,"a rollicking ride , with jaw-dropping action sequences , striking villains , a gorgeous color palette , astounding technology , stirring music and a boffo last hour that leads up to a strangely sinister happy ending . "
neg,"a sudsy cautionary tale . "
neg,"it's a bad sign when you're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest . "
neg,"amazingly lame . "
pos,"methodical , measured , and gently tedious in its comedy , secret ballot is a purposefully reductive movie -- which may be why it's so successful at lodging itself in the brain . "
pos,"macdowell , whose wifty southern charm has anchored lighter affairs . . . brings an absolutely riveting conviction to her role . "
neg,"no matter how you slice it , mark wahlberg and thandie newton are not hepburn and grant , two cinematic icons with chemistry galore . "
neg,"a movie that falls victim to frazzled wackiness and frayed satire . "
neg,"an even more predictable , cliche-ridden endeavor than its predecessor . "

neg,"when it comes to entertainment , children deserve better than pokemon 4ever . "
neg,"as david letterman and the onion have proven , the worst of tragedies can be fertile sources of humor , but lawrence has only a fleeting grasp of how to develop them . "
neg,"an often unfunny romp . "
neg,"so routine , familiar and predictable , it raises the possibility that it wrote itself as a newly automated final draft computer program . "
pos,"the film's sense of imagery gives it a terrible strength , but it's propelled by the acting . "
pos,"open-ended and composed of layer upon layer , talk to her is a cinephile's feast , an invitation to countless interpretations . "
neg," . . . familiar and predictable , and 4/5ths of it might as well have come from a xerox machine rather than ( writer-director ) franc . reyes' word processor . "
neg,"divertingly ridiculous , headbangingly noisy . "
neg,"it wouldn't be my preferred way of spending 100 minutes or $7 . 00 . "
neg,"most of the problems with the film don't derive from the screenplay , but rather the mediocre performances by most of the actors involved"
pos,"birthday girl walks a tricky tightrope between being wickedly funny and just plain wicked . "
pos,"pratfalls aside , barbershop gets its greatest play from the timeless spectacle of people really talking to each other . "

pos,"another in a long line of ultra-violent war movies , this one is not quite what it could have been as a film , but the story and theme make up for it . "
neg,"what is captured during the conceptual process doesn't add up to a sufficient explanation of what the final dance work , the selection , became in its final form . "
pos,"we admire this film for its harsh objectivity and refusal to seek our tears , our sympathies . "
neg,"the satire is unfocused , while the story goes nowhere . "
neg,"even on its own ludicrous terms , the sum of all fears generates little narrative momentum , and invites unflattering comparisons to other installments in the ryan series . "
neg,"does little more than play an innocuous game of fill-in- the-blanks with a tragic past . "
pos,"the people in jessica are so recognizable and true that , as in real life , we're never sure how things will work out . "
pos,"a perverse little truffle , dainty psychological terror on the outside with a creamy filling of familial jealousy and unrepentant domestic psychopathy . "
pos,"a smart and funny , albeit sometimes superficial , cautionary tale of a technology in search of an artist . "
neg,"with its dogged hollywood naturalism and the inexorable passage of its characters toward sainthood , windtalkers is nothing but a sticky-sweet soap . "
neg,"a beyond-lame satire , teddy bears' picnic ranks among the most pitiful directing debuts by an esteemed writer-actor . "
neg,"directed without the expected flair or imagination by hong kong master john woo , windtalkers airs just about every cliche in the war movie compendium across its indulgent two-hour-and-fifteen-minute length . "
pos,"a mesmerizing cinematic poem from the first frame to the last . "
neg,"a bore that tends to hammer home every one of its points . "
neg,"a nearly 21/2 hours , the film is way too indulgent . "
neg,"a well-acted , but one-note film . "
pos,"colorful , energetic and sweetly whimsical . . . the rare sequel that's better than its predecessor . "
neg,"it's just too bad the screenwriters eventually shoot themselves in the feet with cop flick cliches like an oily arms dealer , squad car pile-ups and the requisite screaming captain . "
pos,"awesome creatures , breathtaking scenery , and epic battle scenes add up to another 'spectacular spectacle . '"
neg,"witless and utterly pointless . "
pos,"broomfield has a rather unique approach to documentary . he thinks the film is just as much a document about him as it is about the subject . "
neg,"her fans walked out muttering words like  horrible  and  terrible ,  but had so much fun dissing the film that they didn't mind the ticket cost . in this case zero . "
pos,"the film starts out as competent but unremarkable . . . and gradually grows into something of considerable power . "
neg,"screenwriter dan schneider and director shawn levy substitute volume and primary colors for humor and bite . "
pos,"you might want to take a reality check before you pay the full ticket price to see  simone ,  and consider a dvd rental instead . "
neg,"  juwanna mann ?  no thanks . wewannour money back , actually . "
pos,"manages to delight without much of a story . "
pos,"a soul-stirring documentary about the israeli/palestinian conflict as revealed through the eyes of some children who remain curious about each other against all odds . "
pos,"definitely funny stuff , but it's more of the 'laughing at' variety than the 'laughing with . '"
pos,"a very witty take on change , risk and romance , and the film uses humour to make its points about acceptance and growth . "
neg,"a lot of talent is wasted in this crass , low-wattage endeavor . "
neg,"twenty-three movies into a mostly magnificent directorial career , clint eastwood's efficiently minimalist style finally has failed him . big time . "
neg,"black-and-white and unrealistic . "
neg,"high drama , disney-style - a wing and a prayer and a hunky has-been pursuing his castle in the sky . "
pos,"a compelling film . "
pos,"one of those rare , exhilarating cinematic delights that gets even better in hindsight , as you mull over its every nuance in your mind . "
neg,"dull , if not devoid of wit , this shaggy dog longs to frisk through the back alleys of history , but scarcely manages more than a modest , snoozy charm . "
neg,"it plods along methodically , somehow under the assumption that its  dead wife communicating from beyond the grave  framework is even remotely new or interesting . "
pos,"a gentle blend of present day testimonials , surviving footage of burstein and his family performing , historical archives , and telling stills . "
pos,"ludicrous , but director carl franklin adds enough flourishes and freak-outs to make it entertaining . "
neg,"an entertainment so in love with its overinflated mythology that it no longer recognizes the needs of moviegoers for real characters and compelling plots . "
neg,"the animation is competent , and some of the gags are quite funny , but jonah . . . never shakes the oppressive , morally superior good-for-you quality that almost automatically accompanies didactic entertainment . "
neg,"meandering and glacially paced , and often just plain dull . "
pos,"still pretentious and filled with subtext , but entertaining enough at 'face value' to recommend to anyone looking for something different . "
pos,"a bit of a downer and a little over-dramatic at times , but this is a beautiful film for people who like their romances to have that french realism . "
pos,"it's an entertaining movie , and the effects , boosted to the size of a downtown hotel , will all but take you to outer space . "
pos,"a knowing sense of humor and a lot of warmth ignite son of the bride . "
pos,"it's a stunning lyrical work of considerable force and truth . "
pos,"westfeldt and juergensen exude a chemistry and comfort level that's both saucy and endearing . "
neg,"in terms of execution this movie is careless and unfocused . "
pos,"insomnia is one of the year's best films and pacino gives one of his most daring , and complicated , performances . "
neg,"[sam's] self-flagellation is more depressing than entertaining . "
neg,"[a] stuporously solemn film . "
pos,"campanella gets the tone just right -- funny in the middle of sad in the middle of hopeful . "
pos,"it doesn't make for great cinema , but it is interesting to see where one's imagination will lead when given the opportunity . "
pos,"roman polanski's autobiographical gesture at redemption is better than 'shindler's list' - it is more than merely a holocaust movie . "
pos,"an action/thriller of the finest kind , evoking memories of day of the jackal , the french connection , and heat . "
neg,"hampered -- no , paralyzed -- by a self-indulgent script . . . that aims for poetry and ends up sounding like satire . "
neg,"you can see where big bad love is trying to go , but it never quite gets there . "
pos," . . . plenty of warmth to go around , with music and laughter and the love of family . "
neg,"'dragonfly' dwells on crossing-over mumbo jumbo , manipulative sentimentality , and sappy dialogue . "

pos,"a cultural wildcard experience : wacky , different , unusual , even nutty . "
pos,"the beauty of alexander payne's ode to the everyman is in the details . "
pos,"the year's happiest surprise , a movie that deals with a real subject in an always surprising way . "
pos,"mcgrath has deftly trimmed dickens' wonderfully sprawling soap opera , the better to focus on the hero's odyssey from cowering poverty to courage and happiness . "
neg,"it's a brilliant , honest performance by nicholson , but the film is an agonizing bore except when the fantastic kathy bates turns up . bravado kathy ! "
pos,"there's a disreputable air about the whole thing , and that's what makes it irresistible . "
pos,"at its most basic , this cartoon adventure is that wind-in-the-hair exhilarating . "
neg,"girlfriends are bad , wives are worse and babies are the kiss of death in this bitter italian comedy . "
neg,"friday after next has the same problem that next friday did -- it's called where's chris tucker when you need him ? "
neg,"that neither protagonist has a distinguishable condition hardly matters because both are just actory concoctions , defined by childlike dimness and a handful of quirks . "
pos,"a stirring tribute to the bravery and dedication of the world's reporters who willingly walk into the nightmare of war not only to record the events for posterity , but to help us clearly see the world of our making . "
neg,"a poky and pseudo-serious exercise in sham actor workshops and an affected malaise . "
neg,"demme's loose approach kills the suspense . "
pos,"as adapted by kevin molony from simon leys' novel  the death of napoleon  and directed by alan taylor , napoleon's journey is interesting but his parisian rebirth is stillborn"
pos,"this is one of the outstanding thrillers of recent years . "
pos,"that jack nicholson makes this man so watchable is a tribute not only to his craft , but to his legend . "
pos,"he's the scariest guy you'll see all summer . "
neg,"the drama discloses almost nothing . "
neg,"so muddled , repetitive and ragged that it says far less about the horrifying historical reality than about the filmmaker's characteristic style . "

neg,"lacking substance and soul , crossroads comes up shorter than britney's cutoffs . "
neg,"does anyone much think the central story of brendan behan is that he was a bisexual sweetheart before he took to drink ? "
pos,"a solid , spooky entertainment worthy of the price of a ticket . "
neg,"for all the time we spend with these people , we never really get inside of them . "
neg,"the movie makes absolutely no sense . its underlying mythology is a hodgepodge of inconsistencies that pose the question : since when did dumb entertainment have to be this dumb ? "
neg,"a dull , simple-minded and stereotypical tale of drugs , death and mind-numbing indifference on the inner-city streets . "
neg,"narratively , trouble every day is a plodding mess . "
pos,"an enjoyable above average summer diversion . "
neg,"john leguizamo may be a dramatic actor -- just not in this movie . "
pos,"a powerful and telling story that examines forbidden love , racial tension , and other issues that are as valid today as they were in the 1950s . "
pos,"it's not a classic spy-action or buddy movie , but it's entertaining enough and worth a look . "

pos,"the story feels more like a serious read , filled with heavy doses of always enticing sayles dialogue . "

neg,"donovan . . . squanders his main asset , jackie chan , and fumbles the vital action sequences . "

pos,"familiar but utterly delightful . "
pos,"the symbols float like butterflies and the spinning styx sting like bees . i wanted more . "
neg,"the film doesn't have enough innovation or pizazz to attract teenagers , and it lacks the novel charm that made spy kids a surprising winner with both adults and younger audiences . "

pos,"it's a perfect show of respect to just one of those underrated professionals who deserve but rarely receive it . "
pos,"the most wondrous love story in years , it is a great film . "
neg,"once again , the intelligence of gay audiences has been grossly underestimated , and a meaty plot and well-developed characters have been sacrificed for skin and flash that barely fizzle . "
pos,"antwone fisher certainly does the trick of making us care about its protagonist and celebrate his victories but , with few exceptions , it rarely stoops to cheap manipulation or corny conventions to do it . "
pos,"the strength of the film comes not from any cinematic razzle-dazzle but from its recovery of an historical episode that , in the simple telling , proves simultaneously harrowing and uplifting . "

pos,"there are moments of hilarity to be had . "
pos,"kosminsky . . . puts enough salt into the wounds of the tortured and self-conscious material to make it sting . "

pos,"successfully blended satire , high camp and yet another sexual taboo into a really funny movie . "
neg,"the problem isn't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball . "
neg,"adam sandler's 8 crazy nights is 75 wasted minutes of sandler as the voice-over hero in columbia pictures' perverse idea of an animated holiday movie . "
neg,"the story , touching though it is , does not quite have enough emotional resonance or variety of incident to sustain a feature , and even at 85 minutes it feels a bit long . "
neg,"the movie is a mess from start to finish . "
pos,"thoroughly engrossing and ultimately tragic . "
neg,"being unique doesn't necessarily equate to being good , no matter how admirably the filmmakers have gone for broke . "
neg,"kim ki-deok seems to have in mind an ( emotionally at least ) adolescent audience demanding regular shocks and bouts of barely defensible sexual violence to keep it interested . "
neg,"movies like this are selling the old european candor , the old wink of 'bold' revelation . but in 2002 , such revelations wilt . "
neg,"a wannabe comedy of manners about a brainy prep-school kid with a mrs . robinson complex founders on its own preciousness -- and squanders its beautiful women . "
pos,"the fun of the movie is the chance it affords to watch jackson , who also served as executive producer , take his smooth , shrewd , powerful act abroad . "
pos,"it's sweet . it's funny . it wears its heart on the sleeve of its gaudy hawaiian shirt . and , thanks to the presence of 'the king , ' it also rocks . "

pos,"this seductive tease of a thriller gets the job done . it's a scorcher . "
neg,"made me feel uneasy , even queasy , because [solondz's] cool compassion is on the border of bemused contempt . "

neg,"it is bad , but certainly not without merit as entertainment . "
neg,"to build a feel-good fantasy around a vain dictator-madman is off-putting , to say the least , not to mention inappropriate and wildly undeserved . "
neg,"a little less extreme than in the past , with longer exposition sequences between them , and with fewer gags to break the tedium . "
neg,"build some robots , haul 'em to the theatre with you for the late show , and put on your own mystery science theatre 3000 tribute to what is almost certainly going to go down as the worst -- and only -- killer website movie of this or any other year . "
pos,"a smart , compelling drama . "

pos,"land , people and narrative flow together in a stark portrait of motherhood deferred and desire explored . "
pos,"as the story moves inexorably through its seven day timeframe , the picture becomes increasingly mesmerizing . "
neg,"a period story about a catholic boy who tries to help a jewish friend get into heaven by sending the audience straight to hell . "
neg,"drives for the same kind of bittersweet , conciliatory tone that three seasons achieved but loses its way in rhetorical excess and blatant sentimentality . "
neg,"obvious politics and rudimentary animation reduce the chances that the appeal of hey arnold ! the movie will reach far beyond its core demographic . "
neg,"walsh can't quite negotiate the many inconsistencies in janice's behavior or compensate for them by sheer force of charm . "
neg,"jaw-droppingly superficial , straining to get by on humor that is not even as daring as john ritter's glory days on three's company . "
neg,"it follows the blair witch formula for an hour , in which we're told something creepy and vague is in the works , and then it goes awry in the final 30 minutes . "
pos,"thanks to a small star with big heart , this family film sequel is plenty of fun for all . "
neg,"director kevin bray excels in breaking glass and marking off the  miami vice  checklist of power boats , latin music and dog tracks . he doesn't , however , deliver nearly enough of the show's trademark style and flash . "

pos,"it would take a complete moron to foul up a screen adaptation of oscar wilde's classic satire . "
neg,"it's frustrating to see these guys -- who are obviously pretty clever -- waste their talent on parodies of things they probably thought were funniest when they were high . "
pos,"a culture-clash comedy that , in addition to being very funny , captures some of the discomfort and embarrassment of being a bumbling american in europe . "
neg,"the problem with movies about angels is they have a tendency to slip into hokum . a rumor of angels doesn't just slip -- it avalanches into forced fuzziness . "

pos,"it's fun , but the code-talk will fly right over everyone's head"
pos,"only an epic documentary could get it all down , and spike lee's jim brown : all american at long last gives its subject a movie worthy of his talents . "
neg,"julie davis is the kathie lee gifford of film directors , sadly proving once again ego doesn't always go hand in hand with talent . "
neg,"a movie that seems motivated more by a desire to match mortarboards with dead poets society and good will hunting than by its own story . "

pos,"it understands , in a way that speaks forcefully enough about the mechanisms of poverty to transcend the rather simplistic filmmaking . "
pos,"though the plot is predictable , the movie never feels formulaic , because the attention is on the nuances of the emotional development of the delicate characters . "
pos,"smith is careful not to make fun of these curious owners of architectural oddities . instead , he shows them the respect they are due . "
neg,"the smash 'em-up , crash 'em-up , shoot 'em-up ending comes out of nowhere substituting mayhem for suspense . "

neg,"just a bloody mess . "
neg,"well-meaning but inert . "
pos,"atom egoyan has conjured up a multilayered work that tackles any number of fascinating issues"
pos,"a lot of fun , with an undeniable energy sparked by two actresses in their 50s working at the peak of their powers . "

pos,"cremaster 3 is at once a tough pill to swallow and a minor miracle of self-expression . "
neg,"the whole thing plays out with the drowsy heaviness of synchronized swimmer wearing a wool wetsuit . "
neg,"it's fitfully funny but never really takes off . "
pos,"there's something auspicious , and daring , too , about the artistic instinct that pushes a majority-oriented director like steven spielberg to follow a . i . with this challenging report so liable to unnerve the majority . "
neg,"debut effort by  project greenlight  winner is sappy and amateurish . "
neg,"reggio and glass so rhapsodize cynicism , with repetition and languorous slo-mo sequences , that glass's dirgelike score becomes a fang-baring lullaby . "
neg,"chaotic , self-indulgent and remarkably ugly to look at , it's . . . like a series of pretentiously awful student films strung together into one feature-length horror . "
neg,"  not really as bad as you might think !  "
neg,"that is essentially what's missing from blackboards -- the sense of something bigger , some ultimate point . "
pos,"williams plays sy , another of his open-faced , smiling madmen , like the killer in insomnia . he does this so well you don't have the slightest difficulty accepting him in the role . "
neg,"it's difficult to conceive of anyone who has reached puberty actually finding the characters in slackers or their antics amusing , let alone funny . "
pos,"easier to respect than enthuse over , andersson's rigorous personal vision is not only distanced but distancing . "
neg,"you would be better off investing in the worthy emi recording that serves as the soundtrack , or the home video of the 1992 malfitano-domingo production . "
neg,"what you get with empire is a movie you've seen many times before , repackaged as new material because there is a latino in the lead . "
neg,"none of this so-called satire has any sting to it , as if woody is afraid of biting the hand that has finally , to some extent , warmed up to him . "
neg,"this slender plot feels especially thin stretched over the nearly 80-minute running time . "
pos,"gorgeous scenes , masterful performances , but the sickly sweet gender normative narrative left an acrid test in this gourmet's mouth . "
neg,"it's not as awful as some of the recent hollywood trip tripe . . . but it's far from a groundbreaking endeavor . "
neg,"every nanosecond of the the new guy reminds you that you could be doing something else far more pleasurable . something like scrubbing the toilet . or emptying rat traps . or doing last year's taxes with your ex-wife . "
neg,"insufferably naive . "
neg,"literally nothing in the pool is new , but if you grew up on the stalker flicks of the 1980's this one should appease you for 90 minutes . "
neg,"an uplifting drama . . . what antwone fisher isn't , however , is original . "
pos,"this is pretty dicey material . but some unexpected zigs and zags help . "
pos,"the old-world- meets-new mesh is incarnated in the movie's soundtrack , a joyful effusion of disco bollywood that , by the end of monsoon wedding , sent my spirit soaring out of the theater . "
neg,"if you really want to understand what this story is really all about , you're far better served by the source material . "
pos,"tim allen is great in his role but never hogs the scenes from his fellow cast , as there are plenty of laughs and good lines for everyone in this comedy . "
neg,"one-sided documentary offers simplistic explanations to a very complex situation . . . . stylistically , the movie is a disaster . "
neg,"it's a film with an idea buried somewhere inside its fabric , but never clearly seen or felt . "
pos,"nettelbeck has crafted an engaging fantasy of flavours and emotions , one part romance novel , one part recipe book . "
neg,"written , flatly , by david kendall and directed , barely , by there's something about mary co-writer ed decter . "
pos,"this new zealand coming-of-age movie isn't really about anything . when it's this rich and luscious , who cares ? "
neg,"well-intentioned though it may be , its soap-opera morality tales have the antiseptic , preprogrammed feel of an after-school special . "
pos,"the 3d images only enhance the film's otherworldly quality , giving it a strange combo of you-are-there closeness with the disorienting unreality of the seemingly broken-down fourth wall of the movie screen . "
neg,"a shame that stealing harvard is too busy getting in its own way to be anything but frustrating , boring , and forgettable . "
neg,"buries an interesting storyline about morality and the choices we make underneath such a mountain of clichés and borrowed images that it might more accurately be titled mr . chips off the old block . "
neg,"cox offers plenty of glimpses at existing photos , but there are no movies of nijinsky , so instead the director treats us to an aimless hodgepodge . "
pos,"exposing the ways we fool ourselves is one hour photo's real strength . "
pos,"the main story . . . is compelling enough , but it's difficult to shrug off the annoyance of that chatty fish . "
neg,"serry does a fine job of capturing the climate of the times and , perhaps unwittingly , relating it to what is happening in america in 2002 . but hard-to-believe plot twists force the movie off track in its final half hour . "
neg,"the high-concept scenario soon proves preposterous , the acting is robotically italicized , and truth-in-advertising hounds take note : there's very little hustling on view . "
neg,"what begins as a seemingly brainless , bubbly romantic comedy becomes a cliche-drenched melodrama by mid-film and , by film's end , a feminist action fantasy . "
neg,"nemesis suffers from a paunchy midsection , several plodding action sequences and a wickedly undramatic central theme . "
neg,"despite juliet stevenon's attempt to bring cohesion to pamela's emotional roller coaster life , it is not enough to give the film the substance it so desperately needs . "
pos,"for a long time the film succeeds with its dark , delicate treatment of these characters and its unerring respect for them . "
neg,"unambitious writing emerges in the movie , using a plot that could have come from an animated-movie screenwriting textbook . "
neg,"will undoubtedly play well in european markets , where mr . besson is a brand name , and in asia , where ms . shu is an institution , but american audiences will probably find it familiar and insufficiently cathartic . "

pos,"it's a good film , but it falls short of its aspiration to be a true 'epic' . "
pos,"though lan yu lacks a sense of dramatic urgency , the film makes up for it with a pleasing verisimilitude . "
pos,"the sweetest thing , a romantic comedy with outrageous tendencies , may be a mess in a lot of ways . but it does have one saving grace . a lot of its gags and observations reflect a woman's point-of-view . "
neg,"a disappointment for those who love alternate versions of the bard , particularly ones that involve deep fryers and hamburgers . "
neg,"an occasionally interesting but mostly repetitive look at a slice of counterculture that might be best forgotten . "

neg,"wait for it to hit cable . "
pos,"a witty , whimsical feature debut . "
neg,"a film neither bitter nor sweet , neither romantic nor comedic , neither warm nor fuzzy . "
neg,"seagal ran out of movies years ago , and this is just the proof . "

pos,"os universos de chuck barris e charlie kaufman são complementares . e igualmente fascinantes . "
pos,"there are problems with this film that even 3 oscar winners can't overcome , but it's a nice girl-buddy movie once it gets rock-n-rolling . "
pos,"me no lika da accents so good , but i thoroughly enjoyed the love story . scott baio is turning in some delightful work on indie projects . "
pos,"you'll be left with the sensation of having just witnessed a great performance and , perhaps , give in to the urge to get on your feet and shake it . "

pos,"the 1960s rebellion was misdirected : you can't fight your culture . "
neg,"if only it were , well , funnier . "
pos,"the film benefits greatly from a less manic tone than its predecessor , as cho appears to have settled comfortably into her skin . "
neg,"considering the harsh locations and demanding stunts , this must have been a difficult shoot , but the movie proves rough going for the audience as well . "
neg,"it's hard to quibble with a flick boasting this many genuine cackles , but notorious c . h . o . still feels like a promising work-in-progress . "
neg,"both stars manage to be funny , but , like the recent i spy , the star chemistry begs the question of whether random gags add up to a movie . "
neg,"there's no denying the elaborateness of the artist's conceptions , nor his ability to depict them with outrageous elan , but really the whole series is so much pretentious nonsense , lavishly praised by those who equate obscurity with profundity . "
neg,"by the time the plot grinds itself out in increasingly incoherent fashion , you might be wishing for a watch that makes time go faster rather than the other way around . "
neg,"the christ allegory doesn't work because there is no foundation for it"
pos,"brave and sweetly rendered love story . "
neg,"its characters are thinner than cardboard -- or even comic-book paper . "
pos,"it extends the writings of jean genet and john rechy , the films of fassbinder , perhaps even the nocturnal works of goya . "
pos,"the long-range appeal of  minority report  should transcend any awards it bags . this is one for the ages . "
pos,"vampire epic succeeds as spooky action-packed trash of the highest order . "
pos,"in painting an unabashedly romantic picture of a nation whose songs spring directly from the lives of the people , the movie exalts the marxian dream of honest working folk , with little to show for their labor , living harmoniously , joined in song . "
pos,"tully is in many ways the perfect festival film : a calm , self-assured portrait of small town regret , love , duty and friendship that appeals to the storytelling instincts of a slightly more literate filmgoing audience . "
neg,"egoyan's movie is too complicated to sustain involvement , and , if you'll excuse a little critical heresy , too intellectually ambitious . "

pos,"japan's premier stylist of sex and blood hits audiences with what may be his most demented film to date . "
neg,"like being invited to a classy dinner soiree and not knowing anyone . you leave the same way you came -- a few tasty morsels under your belt , but no new friends . "
pos,"the film is faithful to what one presumes are the book's twin premises -- that we become who we are on the backs of our parents , but we have no idea who they were at our age ; and that time is a fleeting and precious commodity no matter how old you are . "
neg,"rambles on in a disjointed , substandard fashion from one poorly executed action sequence to the next . "
neg,"degenerates into hogwash . "
neg,"with zoe clarke-williams's lackluster thriller  new best friend  , who needs enemies ? just another generic drama that has nothing going for it other than its exploitive array of obligatory cheap thrills . "
pos,"the french are rather good at this kind of thing , unlike the americans , who have a passion for musketeers , only to spoof them . "
neg,"the setting turns out to be more interesting than any of the character dramas , which never reach satisfying conclusions . "
pos,"we do get the distinct impression that this franchise is drawing to a close . "
neg,"the problem is not that it's all derivative , because plenty of funny movies recycle old tropes . the problem is that van wilder does little that is actually funny with the material . "
pos,"a hidden-agenda drama that shouts classic french nuance . "
neg,"jacobi , the most fluent of actors , is given relatively dry material from nijinsky's writings to perform , and the visuals , even erotically frank ones , become dullingly repetitive . "

pos,"ana's journey is not a stereotypical one of self-discovery , as she's already comfortable enough in her own skin to be proud of her rubenesque physique . . . "

pos,"old-fashioned but thoroughly satisfying entertainment . "
pos,"the huskies are beautiful , the border collie is funny and the overall feeling is genial and decent . "

pos,"transcends its agenda to deliver awe-inspiring , at times sublime , visuals and offer a fascinating glimpse into the subculture of extreme athletes whose derring-do puts the x into the games . "
neg,"reggio's trippy , ambitious downer can also sometimes come across like nothing more than a glorified nike ad . "
neg,"an exceptionally dreary and overwrought bit of work , every bit as imperious as katzenberg's the prince of egypt from 1998 . "
